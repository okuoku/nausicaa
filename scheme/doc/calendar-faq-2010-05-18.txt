Introduction
------------

This is  the calendar FAQ.   Its purpose is  to give an overview  of the
Christian,  Hebrew, Persian, and  Islamic calendars  in common  use.  It
will provide a historical background for the Christian calendar, plus an
overview of  the French Revolutionary  calendar, the Maya  calendar, and
the Chinese calendar.

  Comments are very welcome.  My e-mail address is given above.

Changes in version 2.9
----------------------

Section 2.12: The explanation of the name "April" changed.

Section  2.16: The  definition  of the  Julian  day number  now uses  UT
instead of UTC.

Section 4.9 added.

Section 11.5 added  and the following sections renumbered.   A few minor
corrections have been made.


Writing dates and years
-----------------------

Dates will be written in the  British format (1 January) rather than the
American format (January 1).  Dates will occasionally be abbreviated: "1
Jan" rather than "1 January".

  Years before  and after  the "official" birth  year of Christ  will be
written "45 BC" or "AD 1997", respectively.  I prefer this notation over
the secular "45 BCE" and "1997 CE" (See also section 2.13.4.)


The 'mod' operator
------------------

Throughout this document the operator  'mod' will be used to signify the
modulo  or remainder  operator.  For  example,  17 mod  7=3 because  the
result of the division 17/7 is 2 with a remainder of 3.


The text in square brackets
---------------------------

Square brackets [like this] identify  information that I am unsure about
and  about which  I would  like more  information.  Please  write  me at
<claus@tondering.dk>  (and please  include  the word  "calendar" in  the
subject line).

1. What Astronomical Events Form the Basis of Calendars?
--------------------------------------------------------

Calendars are  normally based on  astronomical events, and the  two most
important astronomical objects  are the sun and the  moon.  Their cycles
are very important in the construction and understanding of calendars.

  Our concept of  a year is based on the earth's  motion around the sun.
The time  from one fixed  point, such as  a solstice or equinox,  to the
next is  called a "tropical  year".  Its length is  currently 365.242190
days, but  it varies.  Around 1900  its length was  365.242196 days, and
around  2100  it will  be  365.242184  days.   (This definition  of  the
tropical year is not quite accurate, see section 1.1 for more details.)

  Our concept of a month is based on the moon's motion around the earth,
although this connection  has been broken in the  calendar commonly used
now.   The time  from one  new moon  to the  next is  called  a "synodic
month",  and its  length is  currently 29.5305889  days, but  it varies.
Around 1900 its  length was 29.5305886 days, and around  2100 it will be
29.5305891 days.

  Note  that  these  numbers  are  averages.  The  actual  length  of  a
particular year may vary by several  minutes due to the influence of the
gravitational force from other planets.  Similarly, the time between two
new  moons  may vary  by  several  hours due  to  a  number of  factors,
including  changes in  the gravitational  force  from the  sun, and  the
moon's orbital inclination.

  It  is unfortunate  that the  length  of the  tropical year  is not  a
multiple of  the length of the  synodic month.  This means  that with 12
months per year, the relationship  between our month and the moon cannot
be maintained.

  However, 19  tropical years is  234.997 synodic months, which  is very
close to an integer.   So every 19 years the phases of  the moon fall on
the  same dates  (if it  were not  for the  skewness introduced  by leap
years).  19 years is called  a Metonic cycle (after Meton, an astronomer
from Athens in the 5th century BC).

  So, to summarise, there are three important numbers to note:

* A tropical year is 365.24219 days.

* A synodic month is 29.53059 days.

* 19 tropical years is close to an integral number of synodic months.

  The Christian calendar is based on  the motion of the earth around the
sun, while the months retain no connection with the motion of the moon.

  On the other hand, the Islamic  calendar is based on the motion of the
moon, while  the year  has no  connection with the  motion of  the earth
around the sun.

  Finally,  the Hebrew  calendar combines  both, in  that its  years are
linked to  the motion of  the earth around  the sun, and its  months are
linked to the motion of the moon.


1.1. What are equinoxes and solstices?
--------------------------------------

Equinoxes  and  solstices  are  frequently  used as  anchor  points  for
calendars.  For people in the northern hemisphere:

* Winter  solstice is  the time  in December  when the  sun  reaches its
  southernmost latitude.   At this  time we have  the shortest  day. The
  date is near 21 December.

* Summer  solstice  is  the  time  in  June when  the  sun  reaches  its
  northernmost latitude.   At this  time we have  the longest  day.  The
  date is near 21 June.

* Vernal equinox  is the time in  March when the sun  passes the equator
  moving from  the southern to  the northern hemisphere.  Day  and night
  have approximately the same length.  The date is near 20 March.

* Autumnal  equinox is the  time in  September when  the sun  passes the
  equator moving from the northern  to the southern hemisphere.  Day and
  night  have  approximately the  same  length.   The  date is  near  22
  September.

  For people in the southern hemisphere, winter solstice occurs in June,
vernal equinox in September, etc.

  The  astronomical "tropical year"  is frequently  defined as  the time
between,  say, two  vernal equinoxes,  but  this is  not actually  true.
Currently the time between two vernal equinoxes is slightly greater than
the tropical year.  The reason is that the earth's position in its orbit
at the time of solstices and equinoxes shifts slightly each year (taking
approximately 21,000 years to move  all the way around the orbit).  This
gradual  change, called "precession",  combined with  the fact  that the
earth's  orbit is  not  completely circular,  causes  the equinoxes  and
solstices to shift with respect to each other.

  The astronomer's  mean tropical year  is really a  somewhat artificial
average of  the period  between the time  when the  sun is in  any given
position in the sky with respect  to the equinoxes and the next time the
sun is in the same position.



2. The Christian Calendar
-------------------------

The "Christian calendar" is the term traditionally used to designate the
calendar commonly in use, although it originated in pre-Christian Rome.

  The Christian  calendar has years of  365 or 366 days.   It is divided
into 12 months that have no  relationship to the motion of the moon.  In
parallel with  this system,  the concept of  "weeks" groups the  days in
sets of 7.

  Two main  versions of  the Christian calendar  have existed  in recent
times: the  Julian calendar and the Gregorian  calendar.  The difference
between them lies in the way they approximate the length of the tropical
year and their rules for calculating Easter.


2.1. What is the Julian calendar?
---------------------------------

The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC.  It was in
common use until the late  1500s, when countries started changing to the
Gregorian calendar (section 2.2).  However, some countries (for example,
Greece and Russia) used it into the early 1900s, and the Orthodox church
in Russia still uses it, as do some other Orthodox churches.

  In the Julian  calendar, the tropical year is  approximated as 365 1/4
days = 365.25  days.  This gives an error of 1  day in approximately 128
years.

  The approximation  365 1/4 is achieved  by having 1 leap  year every 4
years.


2.1.1. What years are leap years?
---------------------------------

The Julian calendar has 1 leap year every 4 years:

        Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year.

However, the 4-year  rule was not followed in the  first years after the
introduction of the Julian calendar in  45 BC.  Due to a counting error,
every 3rd  year was a  leap year in  the first years of  this calendar's
existence.  The leap years were:

        45 BC(?), 42 BC, 39 BC, 36 BC, 33 BC, 30 BC,
        27 BC, 24 BC, 21 BC, 18 BC, 15 BC, 12 BC, 9 BC,
        AD 8, AD 12, and every 4th year from then on.

authorities disagree about whether 45 BC was a leap year or not.

  There were no leap years between 9  BC and AD 8 (or, according to some
authorities, between  12 BC and AD  4).  This period  without leap years
was decreed by  emperor Augustus in order to make up  for the surplus of
leap  years introduced  previously, and  it earned  him a  place  in the
calendar as the 8th month was named after him.

  It is a curious fact that although the method of reckoning years after
the  (official) birthyear  of Christ  was not  introduced until  the 6th
century,  by some stroke  of luck  the Julian  leap years  coincide with
years of our Lord that are divisible by 4.


2.1.2. What consequences did the use of the Julian calendar have?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Julian  calendar introduces an error  of 1 day every  128 years.  So
every 128 years the tropical  year shifts one day backwards with respect
to the calendar.  Furthermore, the  method for calculating the dates for
Easter was inaccurate and needed to be refined.

  In order to remedy this, two steps were necessary:

1. The Julian calendar had to be replaced by something more adequate.

2. The extra days that the Julian calendar had inserted had to be
   dropped.

  The solution  to problem  1) was the  Gregorian calendar  described in
section 2.2.

  The solution to problem 2) depended  on the fact that it was felt that
21 March was the proper day for vernal equinox (because 21 March was the
date for  vernal equinox during the  Council of Nicaea in  AD 325).  The
Gregorian  calendar was  therefore calibrated  to make  that  day vernal
equinox.

  By 1582  vernal equinox had moved (1582-325)/128  days = approximately
10 days backwards.  So 10 days had to be dropped.


2.2. What is the Gregorian calendar?
------------------------------------

The Gregorian calendar is the  one commonly used today.  It was proposed
by Aloysius Lilius, a physician from Naples, and adopted by Pope Gregory
XIII  in  accordance  with   instructions  from  the  Council  of  Trent
(1545-1563) to correct for errors  in the older Julian Calendar.  It was
decreed by Pope Gregory XIII in  a papal bull on 24 February 1582.  This
bull is named "Inter Gravissimas" after its first two words.

  In the  Gregorian calendar, the  tropical year is approximated  as 365
97/400 days = 365.2425 days.  Thus it takes approximately 3300 years for
the  tropical  year to  shift  one day  with  respect  to the  Gregorian
calendar.

  The approximation 365 97/400 is achieved by having 97 leap years every
400 years.


2.2.1. What years are leap years?
---------------------------------

The Gregorian calendar has 97 leap years every 400 years:

        Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year.
        However, every year divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
        However, every year divisible by 400 is a leap year after all.

So, 1700,  1800, 1900,  2100, and  2200 are not  leap years.   But 1600,
2000, and 2400 are leap years.

(Destruction of  a myth: There are  no double leap years,  i.e. no years
with 367 days. See, however, the note on Sweden in section 2.2.4.)


2.2.2. Isn't there a 4000-year rule?
------------------------------------

It has been suggested (by the astronomer John Herschel (1792-1871) among
others) that a  better approximation to the length  of the tropical year
would be  365 969/4000  days = 365.24225  days.  This would  dictate 969
leap years every 4000 years, rather  than the 970 leap years mandated by
the Gregorian  calendar.  This  could be achieved  by dropping  one leap
year  from the  Gregorian calendar  every 4000  years, which  would make
years divisible by 4000 non-leap years.

This rule has, however, not been officially adopted.


2.2.3. Don't the Greeks do it differently?
------------------------------------------

When  the Orthodox church  in Greece  finally decided  to switch  to the
Gregorian calendar in the 1920s,  they tried to improve on the Gregorian
leap year rules, replacing the "divisible by 400" rule by the following:

        Every year which  when divided by 900 leaves  a remainder of 200
        or 600 is a leap year.

  This makes  1900, 2100,  2200, 2300, 2500,  2600, 2700,  2800 non-leap
years,  whereas 2000,  2400, and  2900 are  leap years.   This  will not
create a conflict with the rest of the world until the year 2800.

  This rule  gives 218  leap years  every 900 years,  which gives  us an
average year  of 365 218/900 days  = 365.24222 days,  which is certainly
more accurate than the official Gregorian number of 365.2425 days.

  However, this rule is *not* official in Greece.


2.2.4. When did country X change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The papal bull  of February 1582 decreed that 10  days should be dropped
from October 1582  so that 15 October should  follow immediately after 4
October, and from then on the reformed calendar should be used.

  This  was  observed  in  Italy,  Poland, Portugal,  and  Spain.  Other
Catholic countries followed shortly after, but Protestant countries were
reluctant  to change,  and the  Greek orthodox  countries  didn't change
until the start of the 1900s.

Changes in the 1500s required 10 days to be dropped.
Changes in the 1600s required 10 days to be dropped.
Changes in the 1700s required 11 days to be dropped.
Changes in the 1800s required 12 days to be dropped.
Changes in the 1900s required 13 days to be dropped.

(Exercise for the reader:  why is the error in the 1600s  the same as in
the 1500s.)

The  following  list contains  the  dates for  changes  in  a number  of
countries.  It is very strange that in many cases there seems to be some
doubt  among authorities  about what  the correct  days  are.  Different
sources give  very different dates in  some cases.  The  list below does
not include all the different opinions about when the change took place.

Albania:        December 1912

Austria: Different regions on different dates
         Brixen, Salzburg and Tyrol:
                 5 Oct 1583 was followed by 16 Oct 1583
         Carinthia and Styria:
                14 Dec 1583 was followed by 25 Dec 1583
         See also Czechoslovakia and Hungary

Belgium: See the Netherlands

Bulgaria:       31 Mar 1916 was followed by 14 Apr 1916

Canada: Different areas changed at different times.
        Newfoundland and Hudson Bay coast:
                2 Sep 1752 was followed by 14 Sep 1752
        Mainland Nova Scotia:
                Gregorian 1605 - 13 Oct 1710
                Julian 2 Oct 1710 - 2 Sep 1752
                Gregorian since 14 Sep 1752
        Rest of Canada:
                Gregorian from first European settlement

China:          The Gregorian calendar replaced the Chinese calendar
                in 1912, but the Gregorian calendar was not used
                throughout the country until the communist revolution
                of 1949.

Czechoslovakia (i.e. Bohemia and Moravia):
                 6 Jan 1584 was followed by 17 Jan 1584

Denmark (including Norway):
                18 Feb 1700 was followed by 1 Mar 1700

Egypt:          1875

Estonia:        31 Jan 1918 was followed by 14 Feb 1918

Finland: Then part of Sweden. (Note, however, that Finland later
                became part of Russia, which then still used the
                Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar remained
                official in Finland, but some use of the Julian
                calendar was made.)

France:         9 Dec 1582 was followed by 20 Dec 1582
                Alsace: 5 Feb 1682 was followed by 16 Feb 1682

  Sweden has a curious history.  Sweden decided to make a gradual change
from the Julian to the  Gregorian calendar.  By dropping every leap year
from 1700 through 1740 the  eleven superfluous days would be omitted and
from 1 Mar 1740 they would be in sync with the Gregorian calendar.  (But
in the meantime they would be in sync with nobody!)

  So 1700  (which should have been  a leap year in  the Julian calendar)
was not a leap year in Sweden.  However, by mistake 1704 and 1708 became
leap  years.  This  left Sweden  out  of synchronisation  with both  the
Julian and  the Gregorian  world, so  they decided to  go *back*  to the
Julian calendar.   In order to  do this, they  inserted an extra  day in
1712, making that year a double  leap year!  So in 1712, February had 30
days in Sweden.

  Later, in 1753,  Sweden changed to the Gregorian  calendar by dropping
11 days like everyone else.


2.3. What day is the leap day?
------------------------------

It is 24 February!

  Weird?  Yes!  The explanation is  related to the Roman calendar and is
found in section 2.8.1.

  From a  numerical point of  view, of course  29 February is  the extra
day.  But from  the point  of  view of  celebration of  feast days,  the
following correspondence  between days in leap years  and non-leap years
has traditionally been used:

        Non-leap year           Leap year
        -------------           ----------
        22 February             22 February
        23 February             23 February
                                24 February (extra day)
        24 February             25 February
        25 February             26 February
        26 February             27 February
        27 February             28 February
        28 February             29 February

  For  example, the  feast  of St.  Leander  has been  celebrated on  27
February in non-leap years and on 28 February in leap years.

  Many countries  are gradually changing the  leap day from  the 24th to
the  29th.  This affects  countries  such  as  Sweden and  Austria  that
celebrate "name days" (i.e. each day is associated with a name).


2.4. What is the Solar Cycle?
-----------------------------

In the Julian calendar the relationship between the days of the week and
the  dates of  the  year is  repeated in  cycles  of 28  years.  In  the
Gregorian  calendar this is  still true  for periods  that do  not cross
years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400.

  A period of 28 years is called a Solar Cycle.  The "Solar Number" of a
year is found as:

        Solar Number = (year + 8) mod 28 + 1

  In the Julian calendar there  is a one-to-one relationship between the
Solar Number and the day on which a particular date falls.

  (The leap year cycle of the  Gregorian calendar is 400 years, which is
146,097 days,  which curiously  enough is  a multiple of  7.  So  in the
Gregorian  calendar the  equivalent of  the "Solar  Cycle" would  be 400
years, not 7*400=2800 years as one might be tempted to believe.)


2.5. What is the Dominical Letter?
----------------------------------

  Each ordinary (non-leap)  year is assigned a letter in the  range A to G
which describes what days of the year are Sundays. This letter is called
the "Dominical Letter" ("Sunday Letter") of the year.

  It works in this manner: assign the letter A to 1 January, B to 2 Jan,
C to 3 Jan, ... G to 7 Jan, A to 8 Jan, B to 9 Jan, and so on, using the
letters A to G and omitting the leap day.

* In a year with Dominical Letter A, all days marked A are Sundays.

* In a year with Dominical Letter B, all days marked B are Sundays.

* And so on.

  Leap  years have two  Dominical Letters,  one which  is used  from the
start of January  until the leap day, and another one  which is used for
the rest of the year.

  The Dominical Letters of 2008 (a leap year) are F and E.


2.6. What day of the week was 2 August 1953?
--------------------------------------------

To calculate  the day  on which a  particular date falls,  the following
algorithm may  be used  (the divisions are  integer divisions,  in which
remainders are discarded):

    a = (14 - month) / 12
    y = year - a
    m = month + 12*a - 2

for Julian calendar:

    d = (5 + day + y + y/4 + (31*m)/12) mod 7

for Gregorian calendar:

    d = (day + y + y/4 - y/100 + y/400 + (31*m)/12) mod 7

the value of d is 0 for a Sunday, 1 for a Monday, 2 for a Tuesday, etc.

Example: On what day of the week was the author born?

  My birthday is 2 August 1953 (Gregorian, of course).

  a = (14 - 8) / 12 = 0
  y = 1953 - 0 = 1953
  m = 8 + 12*0 - 2 = 6
  d = (2 + 1953 + 1953/4 - 1953/100 + 1953/400 + (31*6)/12) mod 7
    = (2 + 1953 + 488 - 19 + 4 + 15 ) mod 7
    = 2443 mod 7
    = 0

  I was born on a Sunday.


2.7. When can I reuse my 1992 calendar?
---------------------------------------

Let us first assume that you  are only interested in which dates fall on
which days of  the week; you are not interested in  the dates for Easter
and other irregular holidays.

  Let us further confine ourselves to the years 1901-2099.

  With these restrictions, the answer is as follows:

* If year X is a leap year, you can reuse its calendar in year X+28.

* If year  X is  the first  year after a  leap year,  you can  reuse its
  calendar in years X+6, X+17, and X+28.

* If year  X is the  second year  after a leap  year, you can  reuse its
  calendar in years X+11, X+17, and X+28.

* If year  X is  the third  year after a  leap year,  you can  reuse its
  calendar in years X+11, X+22, and X+28.

  Note that the expression X+28 occurs  in all four items above.  So you
can always reuse your calendar every 28 years.

  But if  you also want your  calendar's indication of  Easter and other
Christian holidays  to be correct, the  rules are far too  complex to be
put to a  simple formula.  Sometimes calendars can  be reused after just
six years.  For  example, the calendars for the years  1981 and 1987 are
identical, even when  it comes to the date for  Easter.  But sometimes a
very long time  can pass before a calendar can be  reused; if you happen
to have a  calendar from 1940, you  won't be able to reuse  it until the
year 5280!


2.8. What is the Roman calendar?
--------------------------------

Before Julius Caesar introduced the  Julian calendar in 45 BC, the Roman
calendar  was a mess,  and much  of our  so-called "knowledge"  about it
seems to be little more than guesswork.

  Originally, the year started on 1 March and consisted of only 304 days
or  10 months  (Martius,  Aprilis, Maius,  Junius, Quintilis,  Sextilis,
September,  October,  November,  and  December).  These  304  days  were
followed by  an unnamed  and unnumbered winter  period.  The  Roman king
Numa Pompilius  (c.  715-673 BC,  although his historicity  is disputed)
allegedly  introduced  February  and  January (in  that  order)  between
December and  March, increasing  the length  of the year  to 354  or 355
days.  In  450 BC,  February was moved  to its current  position between
January and March.

  In order to  make up for the lack  of days in a year,  an extra month,
Intercalaris or Mercedonius,  (allegedly with 22 or 23  days though some
authorities dispute  this) was introduced in  some years.  In  an 8 year
period the length of the years were:

    1: 12 months or 355 days
    2: 13 months or 377 days
    3: 12 months or 355 days
    4: 13 months or 378 days
    5: 12 months or 355 days
    6: 13 months or 377 days
    7: 12 months or 355 days
    8: 13 months or 378 days

  A total  of 2930 days corresponding to  a year of 366  1/4 days.  This
year was  discovered to  be too  long, and therefore  7 days  were later
dropped from the 8th year, yielding 365.375 days per year.

  This is all theory.  In practice  it was the duty of the priesthood to
keep track  of the calendars, but  they failed miserably,  partly due to
ignorance, partly  because they were  bribed to make certain  years long
and other years short.   Furthermore, leap years were considered unlucky
and were therefore  avoided in time of crisis, such  as the Second Punic
War.

  In order to clean up this mess, Julius Caesar made his famous calendar
reform in 45 BC.  We can make an educated guess about  the length of the
months in the years 47 and 46 BC:

                    47 BC          46 BC
    Januarius        29             29
    Februarius       28             24
    Intercalaris                    27
    Martius          31             31
    Aprilis          29             29
    Maius            31             31
    Junius           29             29
    Quintilis        31             31
    Sextilis         29             29
    September        29             29
    October          31             31
    November         29             29
    Undecember                      33
    Duodecember                     34
    December         29             29
                    ---            ---
    Total           355            445

  The names of the last four months are derived from the Latin words for
nine, eleven, twelve, ten - in that order!

  The length of the  months from 45 BC onward were the  same as the ones
we know today.

  Occasionally one reads the following story:

        "Julius Caesar  made all odd  numbered months 31 days  long, and
        all even numbered  months 30 days long (with  February having 29
        days  in  non-leap  years).   In  44 BC  Quintilis  was  renamed
        'Julius' (July) in honour of Julius Caesar, and in 8 BC Sextilis
        became 'Augustus' in honour  of emperor Augustus.  When Augustus
        had a month named after him, he wanted his month to be a full 31
        days long,  so he  removed a day  from February and  shifted the
        length of the other months so that August would have 31 days."

this story, however,  has no basis in actual fact.  It is a fabrication,
possibly invented  by the English-French scholar  Johannes de Sacrobosco
in the 13th century.


2.8.1. How did the Romans number days?
--------------------------------------

The Romans didn't number the days sequentially from 1.  Instead they had
three fixed points in each month:

"Kalendae" (or "Calendae")
    Which was the first day of the month.

"Idus"
    Which was  the 13th day  of January, February, April,  June, August,
    September, November,  and December, or  the 15th day of  March, May,
    July, or October.

"Nonae"
    Which was the  9th day before Idus (counting Idus  itself as the 1st
    day).

  The days  between Kalendae and Nonae  were called "the  5th day before
Nonae", "the 4th day before Nonae", "the 3rd day before Nonae", and "the
day  before Nonae".  (There  was no  "2nd day  before Nonae".   This was
because of  the inclusive way of  counting used by the  Romans: To them,
Nonae itself was  the first day, and thus "the 2nd  day before" and "the
day before" would mean the same thing.)

  Similarly, the  days between Nonae and  Idus were called  "the Xth day
before Idus",  and the days after  Idus were called "the  Xth day before
Kalendae (of the next month)".

  Julius Caesar decreed that in  leap years the "6th day before Kalendae
of March" should  be doubled.  So in contrast to  our present system, in
which we introduce an extra date  (29 February), the Romans had the same
date twice in  leap years.  The doubling of the  6th day before Kalendae
of March is the origin of the word "bissextile".  If we create a list of
equivalences between the Roman days  and our current days of February in
a leap year, we get the following:

    7th day before Kalendae of March        23 February
    6th day before Kalendae of March        24 February
    6th day before Kalendae of March        25 February
    5th day before Kalendae of March        26 February
    4th day before Kalendae of March        27 February
    3rd day before Kalendae of March        28 February
    the day before Kalendae of March        29 February
    Kalendae of March                        1 March

  You can see that the extra  6th day (going backwards) falls on what is
today  24  February.   For  this  reason  24  February  is  still  today
considered the "extra day" in leap years (see section 2.3).  However, at
certain times in history the second 6th day (25 Feb) has been considered
the leap day.

  Why did Caesar choose to double  the 6th day before Kalendae of March?
It  appears   that  the  leap  month   Intercalaris/Mercedonius  of  the
pre-reform calendar was not placed after February, but inside it, namely
between the 7th and 6th day  before Kalendae of March.  It was therefore
natural to have the leap day in the same position.


2.9. What is the proleptic calendar?
------------------------------------

The Julian  calendar was introduced in  45 BC, but  when historians date
events  prior to  that year,  they normally  extend the  Julian calendar
backward  in time.   This  extended  calendar is  known  as the  "Julian
Proleptic Calendar".

  Similarly, it is possible to extend the Gregorian calendar backward in
time before  1582.  However, this "Gregorian Proleptic  Calendar" is not
commonly used.

  If someone refers to, for example,  15 March 429 BC, they are probably
using the Julian proleptic calendar.

  In the Julian proleptic  calendar, year X BC is a leap  year if X-1 is
divisible by 4.   This is the natural extension of  the Julian leap year
rules.


2.10. Has the year always started on 1 January?
-----------------------------------------------

In some ways, yes.  When Julius Caesar introduced his calendar in 45 BC,
the year started on 1 January, and that was always the date on which the
Solar  Number   and  the  Golden   Number  (see  section   2.13.3)  were
incremented.

  However, the  church didn't like the  wild parties that  took place at
the start of the  new year, and in AD 567 the  council of Tours declared
that having  the year  start on  1 January was  an ancient  mistake that
should be abolished.

  Through  the middle  ages various  New Year  dates were  used.   If an
ancient  document refers  to year  X,  it may  mean any  of 7  different
periods in our present system:

    1 Mar X                     to      28/29 Feb X+1
    1 Jan X                     to      31 Dec X
    1 Jan X-1                   to      31 Dec X-1
   25 Mar X-1                   to      24 Mar X
   25 Mar X                     to      24 Mar X+1
  Saturday before Easter X      to      Friday before Easter X+1
   25 Dec X-1                   to      24 Dec X

  Choosing the  right interpretation of  a year number is  difficult, so
much more as  one country might use different  systems for religious and
civil needs.

  The Byzantine  Empire used a year  starting on 1 Sep,  but they didn't
count years since the birth  of Christ, instead they counted years since
the creation of the world which they dated to 1 September 5509 BC.

  Since about 1600  most countries have used 1 January  as the first day
of  the  year.  Italy  and  England, however,  did  not  make 1  January
official until around 1750.

  In England (but not Scotland) three different years were used:

* The historical year, which started on 1 January.

* The liturgical year, which started on the first Sunday in advent.

* The civil year, which:

  - from the 7th to the 12th century started on 25 December,

  - from the 12th century until 1751 started on 25 March,

  - from 1752 started on 1 January.

  It is  sometimes claimed that having  the year start on  1 January was
part of the Gregorian calendar reform.  This is not true.  This myth has
probably started because in 1752 England  moved the start of the year to
1 January and also changed to the Gregorian calendar.  But in most other
countries  the two  events  were not  related.   Scotland, for  example,
changed to  the Gregorian  calendar together with  England in  1752, but
they moved the start of the year to 1 January in 1600.


2.11. Then what about leap years?
---------------------------------

If the year started on, for  example, 1 March, two months later than our
present year, when was the leap day inserted?

  [The following  information is to the  best of my  knowledge true.  If
anyone can confirm or refute it, please let me know.]

  When it comes to determining if a  year is a leap year, since AD 8 the
Julian calendar has always had 48  months between two leap days.  So, in
a country using a year starting on  1 March, 1439 would have been a leap
year, because their  February 1439 would correspond to  February 1440 in
the January-based reckoning.


2.12. What is the origin of the names of the months?
---------------------------------------------------

A lot of  languages, including English, use month  names based on Latin.
Their  origin  is listed  below.   However,  some  languages (Czech  and
Polish, for example) use quite different names.

January
    Latin: Januarius.  Named after the god Janus.

February
    Latin: Februarius.  Named after Februa, the purification festival.

March
    Latin: Martius.  Named after the god Mars.

April
    Latin: Aprilis.   The origin  of the name  is unknown.  It  may come
    from the Latin  word "aperire" ("to open"), or -  more likely - from
    the ancient Latin prefix "apter-" ("subsequent").

May
    Latin: Maius.  Named after the goddess Maia or the god Maius.

June
    Latin: Junius.  Named after the goddess Juno.

July
    Latin: Julius.   Named after Julius Caesar  in 44 BC.  Prior to that
    time its name was Quintilis  from the word "quintus", fifth, because
    it was the 5th month in the old Roman calendar.

August
    Latin: Augustus.  Named after  emperor Augustus in  8 BC.   Prior to
    that  time the  name was  Sextilis  from the  word "sextus",  sixth,
    because it was the 6th month in the old Roman calendar.

September
    Latin: September.  From the word "septem", seven, because it was the
    7th month in the old Roman calendar.

October
    Latin: October.  From the word "octo", eight, because it was the 8th
    month in the old Roman calendar.

November
    Latin: November.   From the word  "novem", nine, because it  was the
    9th month in the old Roman calendar.

December
    Latin: December.   From the  word "decem", ten,  because it  was the
    10th month in the old Roman calendar.


2.13. What is Easter?
---------------------

In the Christian  world, Easter (and the days  immediately preceding it)
is  the  celebration   of  the  death  and  resurrection   of  Jesus  in
(approximately) AD 30.


2.13.1. When is Easter? (Short answer)
--------------------------------------

Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first full moon after vernal
equinox.


2.13.2. When is Easter? (Long answer)
-------------------------------------

The calculation  of Easter  is complicated because  it is linked  to (an
inaccurate version of) the Hebrew calendar.

  Jesus was crucified immediately before the Jewish Passover, which is a
celebration  of  the  Exodus  from  Egypt under  Moses.  Celebration  of
Passover started on the 15th day of the (spring) month of Nisan.  Jewish
months start when  the moon is new, therefore the 15th  day of the month
must be immediately after a full moon.

  It was therefore decided to  make Easter Sunday the first Sunday after
the  first full  moon after  vernal equinox.  Or more  precisely: Easter
Sunday is  the first Sunday after  the *official* full moon  on or after
the *official* vernal equinox.

  The official vernal equinox is always 21 March.

  The official full moon may differ  from the *real* full moon by one or
two days.

  (Note, however, that historically, some countries have used the *real*
(astronomical) full  moon instead of  the official one  when calculating
Easter.   This was  the  case,  for example,  of  the German  Protestant
states, which used the astronomical full moon in the years 1700-1776.  A
similar  practice was  used  in Sweden  in  the years  1740-1844 and  in
Denmark in the 1700s.)

  The full  moon that precedes Easter  is called the  Paschal full moon.
Two concepts  play an important  role when calculating the  Paschal full
moon:  the Golden  Number  and the  Epact.   They are  described in  the
following sections.

  The following  sections give details  about how to calculate  the date
for Easter.  Note,  however, that while the Julian  calendar was in use,
it was  customary to  use tables rather  than calculations  to determine
Easter.  The following sections do mention how to calculate Easter under
the Julian  calendar, but  the reader  should be aware  that this  is an
attempt to express in formulas  what was originally expressed in tables.
The  formulas can  be taken  as  a good  indication of  when Easter  was
celebrated in the Western Church from approximately the 6th century.


2.13.3. What is the Golden Number?
----------------------------------

Each year is associated with a Golden Number.

  Considering that  the relationship between  the moon's phases  and the
days of the year repeats itself  every 19 years (as described in chapter
1), it is natural to associate a number between 1 and 19 with each year.
This  number is  the so-called  Golden Number.   It is  calculated thus:

    GoldenNumber = (year mod 19)+1

  In years which have the same  Golden Number, the new moon will fall on
(approximately)  the  same date.  The  Golden  Number  is sufficient  to
calculate the Paschal full moon in the Julian calendar.


2.13.4. How does one calculate Easter then?
-------------------------------------------

Under the Julian calendar the method was simple.  If you know the Golden
Number of the year, you can find the Paschal full moon in this table:

   Golden                 Golden                 Golden
   Number   Full moon     Number   Full moon     Number   Full moon
   ------------------     ------------------     ------------------
     1       5 April         8     18 April        15      1 April
     2      25 March         9      7 April        16     21 March
     3      13 April        10     27 March        17      9 April
     4       2 April        11     15 April        18     29 March
     5      22 March        12      4 April        19     17 April
     6      10 April        13     24 March
     7      30 March        14     12 April

  Easter Sunday is the first  Sunday following the above full moon date.
If  the full  moon falls  on a  Sunday, Easter  Sunday is  the following
Sunday.

  (In particular  in the Eastern  Orthodox Churches, an  additional rule
that Easter must come after the  Jewish Passover has been used.  As time
went by,  this rule became  less important, as  the error in  the Julian
calendar caused Easter to fall later in spring.)

  Under  the Gregorian  calendar, things  became much  more complicated.
One  of  the  changes  made  in  the Gregorian  calendar  reform  was  a
modification of the  way Easter was calculated.  There  were two reasons
for this.  First,  the 19 year cycle of the phases  of moon (the Metonic
cycle) was known not to  be perfect.  Secondly, the Metonic cycle fitted
the Gregorian  calendar year  worse than it  fitted the  Julian calendar
year.

  It was therefore decided to  base Easter calculations on the so-called
Epact.


2.13.5. What is the Epact?
--------------------------

Each year is associated with an Epact.

  The Epact is a measure of the age of the moon (i.e. the number of days
that have passed since an "official" new moon) on a particular date.

  (In this context a "new moon"  is the first visible crescent moon.  In
modern calendars, a "new moon" is the completely invisble moon.  The two
differ by  approximately one  day, and this  difference must be  kept in
mind  when  comparing  the  new  moon  calculations  presented  here  to
reality.)

  In the Julian calendar, the Epact is  the age of the moon on 22 March.
In the Gregorian calendar, the Epact is the age of the moon at the start
of the year.

  The  Epact is linked  to the  Golden Number  in the  following manner:
under  the Julian  calendar,  19 years  were  assumed to  be exactly  an
integral number of synodic months, and the following relationship exists
between the Golden Number and the Epact:

        Epact = (11 * (GoldenNumber-1)) mod 30

if  this formula  yields zero,  the  Epact is  by convention  frequently
designated  by the symbol  * and  its value  is said  to be  30.  Weird?
Maybe, but people didn't like the number zero in the old days.

  Since there  are only 19 possible  golden numbers, the  Epact can have
only 19 different values: 1, 3, 4, 6,  7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20,
22, 23, 25, 26, 28, and 30.

  In the Gregorian calendar reform,  some modifications were made to the
simple relationship between the Golden Number and the Epact.

  In the  Gregorian calendar  the Epact should  be calculated  thus (the
divisions are integer divisions, in which remainders are discarded):

1) Use the Julian formula:

      JulianEpact = (11 * (GoldenNumber-1)) mod 30

2) Calculate the so-called "Solar Equation":

        S = (3*century)/4

   The Solar  Equation is  an expression of  the difference  between the
   Julian and the  Gregorian calendar.  The value of  S increases by one
   in every century year that is not a leap year.

   (For the purpose of this calculation century=20 is used for the years
   1900 through  1999, and similarly for other  centuries, although this
   contradicts the rules in section 2.14.3.)

3) Calculate the so-called "Lunar Equation":

        L = (8*century + 5)/25

   The Lunar  Equation is  an expression of  the difference  between the
   Julian calendar  and the Metonic cycle.  The value of  L increases by
   one 8 times every 2500 years.

4) Calculate the Gregorian epact thus:

        GregorianEpact = JulianEpact - S + L + 8

   The number 8 is a constant  that calibrates the starting point of the
   Gregorian Epact so that it matches  the actual age of the moon on new
   year's day.

5) Add or subtract 30 until GregorianEpact lies between 1 and 30.

  In the Gregorian calendar, the Epact can have any value from 1 to 30.

Example: What was the Epact for 1992?

    GoldenNumber = 1992 mod 19 + 1 = 17
    1) JulianEpact = (11 * (17-1)) mod 30 = 26
    2) S = (3*20)/4 = 15
    3) L = (8*20 + 5)/25 = 6
    4) GregorianEpact = 26 - 15 + 6 + 8 = 25
    5) No adjustment is necessary

    The Epact for 1992 was 25.


2.13.6. How does one calculate Gregorian Easter then?
-----------------------------------------------------

Look up the  Epact in this table  to find the date for  the Paschal full
moon:

  Epact   Full moon     Epact   Full moon     Epact   Full moon
  -----------------     -----------------     -----------------
     1    12 April        11     2 April        21    23 March
     2    11 April        12     1 April        22    22 March
     3    10 April        13    31 March        23    21 March
     4     9 April        14    30 March        24    18 April
     5     8 April        15    29 March        25    18 or 17 April
     6     7 April        16    28 March        26    17 April
     7     6 April        17    27 March        27    16 April
     8     5 April        18    26 March        28    15 April
     9     4 April        19    25 March        29    14 April
    10     3 April        20    24 March        30    13 April

Easter Sunday  is the first Sunday  following the above  full moon date.
If  the full  moon falls  on a  Sunday, Easter  Sunday is  the following
Sunday.

  An Epact of 25 requires special  treatment, as it has two dates in the
above table.  There are two  equivalent methods for choosing the correct
full moon date:

A) Choose  18 April, unless the  current century contains  years with an
   epact of 24, in which case 17 April should be used.

B) If  the Golden Number  is > 11  choose 17 April, otherwise  choose 18
   April.

  The  proof that  these two  statements are  equivalent is  left  as an
exercise  to the reader.  (The frustrated  ones may  contact me  for the
proof.)

Example: When was Easter in 1992?

    In the previous section we found that the Golden Number for 1992 was
    17 and  the Epact was  25.  Looking in  the table, we find  that the
    Paschal full  moon was either 17 or  18 April.  By rule  B above, we
    choose 17 April because the Golden Number > 11.

    17 April 1992 was a  Friday.  Easter Sunday must therefore have been
    19 April.


2.13.7. Isn't there a simpler way to calculate Easter?
------------------------------------------------------

This is  an attempt to boil  down the information given  in the previous
sections (the  divisions are integer divisions, in  which remainders are
discarded):

G = year mod 19

For the Julian calendar:

    I = (19*G + 15) mod 30
    J = (year + year/4 + I) mod 7

For the Gregorian calendar:

    C = year/100
    H = (C - C/4 - (8*C+13)/25 + 19*G + 15) mod 30
    I = H - (H/28)*(1 - (29/(H + 1))*((21 - G)/11))
    J = (year + year/4 + I + 2 - C + C/4) mod 7

Thereafter, for both calendars:

    L = I - J
    EasterMonth = 3 + (L + 40)/44
    EasterDay = L + 28 - 31*(EasterMonth/4)

  This algorithm  is based in part  on the algorithm of  Oudin (1940) as
quoted  in   "Explanatory  Supplement  to   the  Astronomical  Almanac",
P. Kenneth Seidelmann, editor.

  People who  want to dig  into the workings  of this algorithm,  may be
interested to know that:

G
    Is the Golden Number-1.

H
    Is 23-Epact (modulo 30).

I
    Is the number of days from 21 March to the Paschal full moon.

J
    Is the weekday for the Paschal full moon (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.).

L
    Is the number of  days from 21 March to the Sunday  on or before the
    Paschal full moon (a number between -6 and 28).


2.13.8. Isn't there an even simpler way to calculate Easter?
------------------------------------------------------------

If we  confine ourselves  to the years  1900-2099 and consider  only the
Gregorian calendar, the formulas of  the previous section can be further
simplified thus:

    H = (24 + 19*(year mod 19)) mod 30
    I = H - H/28
    J = (year + year/4 + I - 13) mod 7
    L = I - J
    EasterMonth = 3 + (L + 40)/44
    EasterDay = L + 28 - 31*(EasterMonth/4)

(Again,  the divisions are  integer divisions,  in which  remainders are
discarded.)


2.13.9. Is there a simple relationship between two consecutive Easters?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppose you  know the Easter  date of the  current year, can  you easily
find the Easter date in the next year?  No, but you can make a qualified
guess.

  If Easter Sunday in the current year  falls on day X and the next year
is not a leap  year, Easter Sunday of next year will  fall on one of the
following days: X-15, X-8, X+13 (rare), or X+20.

  If Easter Sunday in the current year  falls on day X and the next year
is a  leap year,  Easter Sunday  of next year  will fall  on one  of the
following days:  X-16, X-9,  X+12 (extremely rare),  or X+19.  (The jump
X+12 occurs  only once in the  period 1800-2200, namely  when going from
2075 to 2076.)

  If you combine  this knowledge with the fact  that Easter Sunday never
falls before 22 March and never falls after 25 April, you can narrow the
possibilities down to two or three dates.


2.13.10. How frequently are the dates for Easter repeated?
----------------------------------------------------------

The  sequence of  Easter dates  repeats itself  every 532  years  in the
Julian  calendar.   The number  532  is  the  product of  the  following
numbers:

    19 (the Metonic cycle or the cycle of the Golden Number)
    28 (the Solar cycle, see section 2.4)

  The sequence of  Easter dates repeats itself every  5,700,000 years in
the Gregorian  calendar.  Calculating this is  not as simple  as for the
Julian calendar, but the number 5,700,000 turns out to be the product of
the following numbers:

    19 (the Metonic cycle or the cycle of the Golden Number)
   400 (the Gregorian equivalent of the Solar cycle, see section 2.4)
    25 (the cycle used in step 3 when calculating the Epact)
    30 (the number of different Epact values)


2.13.11. What about Greek Orthodox Easter?
------------------------------------------

The Greek Orthodox  Church does not always celebrate  Easter on the same
day as  the Catholic and Protestant  countries.  The reason  is that the
Orthodox Church uses the  Julian calendar when calculating Easter.  This
is  the case  even  in the  churches  that otherwise  use the  Gregorian
calendar.

  When  the Greek  Orthodox  Church in  1923  decided to  change to  the
Gregorian calendar (or rather: a Revised Julian Calendar), they chose to
use  the astronomical  full moon  as the  basis for  calculating Easter,
rather than the "official" full moon described in the previous sections.
And they chose the meridian of  Jerusalem to serve as definition of when
a Sunday  starts.  However, except for  some sporadic use  in the 1920s,
this system was never adopted in practice.


2.13.12. Did the Easter dates change in 2001?
---------------------------------------------

No.

  At  a meeting in  Aleppo, Syria  (5-10 March  1997), organised  by the
World  Council of  Churches and  the  Middle East  Council of  Churches,
representatives  of  several  churches  and Christian  world  communions
suggested  that the  discrepancies  between Easter  calculations in  the
Western  and  the  Eastern   churches  could  be  resolved  by  adopting
astronomically accurate calculations of  the vernal equinox and the full
moon, instead of  using the algorithm presented in  section 2.13.6.  The
meridian of Jerusalem should be used for the astronomical calculations.

  The new  method for calculating  Easter should have taken  effect from
the  year 2001.  In  that year  the  Julian and  Gregorian Easter  dates
coincided (on 15 April Gregorian/2 April Julian), and it would therefore
be a reasonable starting point for the new system.

  However, the Eastern churches (especially the Russian Orthodox Church)
are  reluctant to  change, having  already experienced  a schism  in the
calendar question.  So nothing will happen in the near future.

  If  the  new system  were  introduced,  churches  using the  Gregorian
calendar will  hardly notice  the change.  Only  once during  the period
2001-2025 would these churches note  a difference: in 2019 the Gregorian
method gives  an Easter date  of 21 April,  but the proposed  new method
gives 24 March.

  Note that  the new method makes  an Easter date of  21 March possible.
This date  was not  possible under the  Julian or  Gregorian algorithms.
(Under the  new method, Easter will fall  on 21 March in  the year 2877.
You're all invited to my house on that date!)


2.14. How does one count years?
-------------------------------

In about AD  523, the papal chancellor, Bonifatius, asked  a monk by the
name of  Dionysius Exiguus to devise  a way to implement  the rules from
the Council  of Nicaea (the  so-called "Alexandrine Rules")  for general
use.

  Dionysius Exiguus  (in English known as  Denis the Little)  was a monk
from Scythia, he was a canon  in the Roman Curia, and his assignment was
to prepare  calculations of the  dates of Easter.   At that time  it was
customary to count  years since the reign of  emperor Diocletian; but in
his calculations Dionysius chose to  number the years since the birth of
Christ, rather than honour the persecutor Diocletian.

  Dionysius (wrongly)  fixed Jesus'  birth with respect  to Diocletian's
reign in  such a manner that  it falls on  25 December 753 AUC  (ab urbe
condita, i.e. since  the founding of Rome), thus  making the current era
start with AD 1 on 1 January 754 AUC.

  How Dionysius established the year of Christ's birth is not known (see
section  2.14.1 for a  couple of  theories).  Jesus  was born  under the
reign of  King Herod the  Great, who died  in 750 AUC, which  means that
Jesus  could  have  been  born  no later  than  that  year.   Dionysius'
calculations were disputed at a very early stage.

  When people started dating years before 754 AUC using the term "Before
Christ",  they let  the  year 1  BC  immediately precede  AD  1 with  no
intervening year zero.

  Note,  however,  that  astronomers   frequently  use  another  way  of
numbering the  years BC.  Instead of  1 BC they  use 0, instead of  2 BC
they use -1, instead of 3 BC they use -2, etc.

  See also section 2.14.2.

  The earliest uses of BC dating are found in the works of the Venerable
Bede (673-735).

  In this section I  have used AD 1 = 754 AUC.   This is the most likely
equivalence between  the two  systems.  However, some  authorities state
that AD 1 = 753 AUC or 755  AUC.  This confusion is not a modern one, it
appears that even  the Romans were in some doubt about  how to count the
years since the founding of Rome.


2.14.1. How did Dionysius date Christ's birth?
----------------------------------------------

There are quite a few theories about this.  And many of the theories are
presented as if they were indisputable historical fact.

  Here are two theories that I personally consider likely:

1. According to the Gospel of  Luke (3:1 & 3:23) Jesus was "about thirty
   years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius
   Caesar".  Tiberius  became emperor  in AD 14.   If you  combine these
   numbers you reach  a birthyear for Jesus that  is strikingly close to
   the beginning  of our year reckoning.   This may have  been the basis
   for Dionysius' calculations.

2. Dionysius'  original task was to  calculate an Easter  table.  In the
   Julian calendar,  the dates  for Easter repeat  every 532  years (see
   section 2.13.10).  The  first year in Dionysius' Easter  tables is AD
   532.  Is it a coincidence that  the number 532 appears twice here? Or
   did Dionysius  perhaps fix  Jesus' birthyear so  that his  own Easter
   tables  would start  exactly at  the beginning  of the  second Easter
   cycle after Jesus' birth?


2.14.2. Was Jesus born in the year 0?
-------------------------------------

No.

  There are two reasons for this:

* There is no year 0.

* Jesus was born before 4 BC.

  The concept  of a  year "zero" is  a modern  myth (but a  very popular
one).  In  our calendar,  AD 1  follows immediately after  1 BC  with no
intervening year zero.  So a person who was born in 10 BC and died in AD
10, would have died at the age of 19, not 20.

  Furthermore,  as described  in section  2.14, our  year  reckoning was
established by Dionysius Exiguus in  the 6th century.  Dionysius let the
year AD 1  start one week after what he believed  to be Jesus' birthday.
But Dionysius' calculations were wrong.   The Gospel of Matthew tells us
that Jesus was born under the reign of King Herod the Great, who died in
4 BC.  It is likely that Jesus  was actually born around 7 BC.  The date
of his birth is unknown; it may or may not be 25 December.


2.14.3. When did the 3rd millennium start?
------------------------------------------

The first  millennium started in AD  1, so the millennia  are counted in
this manner:

    1st millennium:    1-1000
    2nd millennium: 1001-2000
    3rd millennium: 2001-3000

  Thus, the 3rd millennium and, similarly, the 21st century started on 1
Jan 2001.

  This  is  the cause  of  some  heated  debate, especially  since  some
dictionaries and encyclopaedias say that  a century starts in years that
end  in 00.  Furthermore, the  change 1999/2000  is obviously  much more
spectacular than the change 2000/2001.

  Let me propose a few compromises:

* Any 100-year period  is a century.  Therefore the  period from 23 June
  2004 to 22  June 2104 is a century.  So please  feel free to celebrate
  the start of a century any day you like!

* Although the 20th century started  in 1901, the 1900s started in 1900.
  Similarly, the 21st century started  in 2001, but the 2000s started in
  2000.


2.14.4. What do AD, BC, CE, and BCE stand for?
----------------------------------------------

Years before the birth of Christ are in English traditionally identified
using the abbreviation BC ("Before Christ").

  Years after the birth of Christ are traditionally identified using the
Latin  abbreviation AD  ("Anno Domini",  that is,  "In the  Year  of the
Lord").

  Some people, who want to avoid the reference to Christ that is implied
in these terms, prefer the abbreviations BCE ("Before the Common Era" or
"Before the Christian Era") and CE ("Common Era" or "Christian Era").


2.15. What is the Indiction?
----------------------------

The Indiction was  used in the middle ages to specify  the position of a
year  in  a  15 year  taxation  cycle.   It  was introduced  by  emperor
Constantine the Great on 1 September 312 and ceased to be used in 1806.

  The Indiction may be calculated thus:

    Indiction = (year + 2) mod 15 + 1

  The Indiction has no astronomical significance.

  The Indiction did not always follow the calendar year. Three different
Indictions may be identified:

1) The  Pontifical or Roman Indiction,  which started on  New Year's Day
   (being either 25 December, 1 January, or 25 March).

2)  The  Greek  or  Constantinopolitan  Indiction, which  started  on  1
   September.

3) The Imperial Indiction or  Indiction of Constantine, which started on

2.16. What is the Julian Period?
--------------------------------

The Julian period (and the Julian  day number) must not be confused with
the Julian calendar.

  The French  scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger  (1540-1609) was interested
in assigning  a positive  number to every  year without having  to worry
about BC/AD.  He invented what is today known as the "Julian Period".

  The Julian  Period probably takes  its name from the  Julian calendar,
although it has  been claimed that it is  named after Scaliger's father,
the Italian scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484-1558).

  Scaliger's Julian period starts on 1 January 4713 BC (Julian calendar)
and  lasts for 7980  years.  AD  2008 is  thus year  6721 in  the Julian
period.  After 7980 years the number starts from 1 again.

  Why 4713 BC  and why 7980 years?  Well, in 4713  BC the Indiction (see
section  2.15), the  Golden Number  (see section  2.13.3) and  the Solar
Number (see  section 2.4) were  all 1.  The  next times this  happens is
15*19*28=7980 years later, in AD 3268.

  Astronomers have used  the Julian period to assign  a unique number to
every day  since 1 January  4713 BC.  This  is the so-called  Julian Day
(JD).  JD 0 designates the 24 hours from noon UT on 1 January 4713 BC to
noon UT on 2 January 4713 BC.  (UT=Universal Time, roughly equivalent to
GMT.)

  This means that at noon UT on 1 January AD 2000, JD 2,451,545 started.

  This can be calculated thus:

    From  4713 BC  to  AD 2000  there  are 6712  years.   In the  Julian
    calendar,  years  have 365.25  days,  so  6712  years correspond  to
    6712*365.25=2,451,558 days.  Subtract from this the 13 days that the
    Gregorian  calendar is  ahead of  the Julian  calendar, and  you get
    2,451,545.

  Often fractions of  Julian day numbers are used, so  that 1 January AD
2000 at 15:00 UT is referred to as JD 2,451,545.125.

  Note that some people use the term "Julian day number" to refer to any
numbering  of days.   NASA, for  example, uses  the term  to  denote the
number of days  since 1 January of the current  year, counting 1 January
as day 1.


2.16.1. Is there a formula for calculating the Julian day number?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Try this one  (the divisions are integer divisions,  in which remainders
are discarded):

   a = (14-month)/12
   y = year + 4800 - a
   m = month + 12 * a - 3

for a date in the Gregorian calendar:

   JD = day + (153*m+2)/5 + y*365 + y/4 - y/100 + y/400 - 32045

for a date in the Julian calendar:

   JD = day + (153*m+2)/5 + y*365 + y/4 - 32083

JD is  the Julian  day number that  starts at  noon UT on  the specified
date.

  The algorithm works  fine for AD dates.  If you want to use  it for BC
dates, you must  first convert the BC year to a  negative year (e.g., 10
BC =  -9). The algorithm  works correctly for  all dates after  4800 BC,
i.e. at least for all positive Julian day numbers.

   convert the other way (i.e., to convert a Julian day number, JD, to a
day, month, and  year) these formulas can be  used (again, the divisions
are integer divisions), for the Gregorian calendar:

    a = JD + 32044
    b = (4*a+3)/146097
    c = a - (b*146097)/4

for the Julian calendar:

    b = 0
    c = JD + 32082

then, for both calendars:

    d = (4*c+3)/1461
    e = c - (1461*d)/4
    m = (5*e+2)/153

    day   = e - (153*m+2)/5 + 1
    month = m + 3 - 12*(m/10)
    year  = b*100 + d - 4800 + m/10


2.16.2. What is the modified Julian day number?
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes  a  modified  Julian  day   number  (MJD)  is  used  which  is
2,400,000.5 less  than the  Julian day number.  This brings  the numbers
into a more manageable numeric range and makes the day numbers change at
midnight UT rather than noon.

  MJD 0 thus started on 17 Nov 1858 (Gregorian) at 00:00:00 UT.


2.16.3. What is the Lilian day number?
--------------------------------------

The Lilian day  number is similar to the Julian  day number, except that
Lilian  day  number 1  started  at  midnight of  the  first  day of  the
Gregorian calendar, that is, 15 October 1582.

  The Lilian  day number was invented by  Bruce G. Ohms of  IBM in 1986.
It is named after Aloysius Lilius mentioned in section 2.2.


2.17. What is the correct way to write dates?
---------------------------------------------

The  answer to  this question  depends on  what you  mean  by "correct".
Different countries have different customs.

  Most countries use a day-month-year format, such as:

    25.12.1998   25/12/1998   25/12-1998   25.XII.1998

  In the U.S.A. a month-day-year format is common:

    12/25/1998   12-25-1998

  International   standard  ISO   8601  (see   chapter  3)   mandates  a
year-month-day  format,  namely  either  1998-12-25 or  19981225.   This
format is gaining popularity in some countries.

  In  all  of these  systems,  the  first two  digits  of  the year  are
frequently omitted:

    25.12.98   12/25/98   98-12-25

  However, although the last form  is frequently seen, it is not allowed
by the ISO standard.

  This confusion leads to misunderstandings.  What is 02-03-04?  To most
people it  is 2  Mar 2004; to  an American it  is 3  Feb 2004; and  to a
person using the international standard it could be 4 Mar 2002 (although
a  year specified  with only  two  digits does  not conform  to the  ISO
standard).

  If you  want to be sure  that people understand you,  I recommend that
you:

* write the month with letters instead of numbers, and

* write the years as 4-digit numbers.



3. ISO 8601
-----------

The International Organization for Standardization, ISO, has published a
standard  on  how to  write  dates,  times,  and time  intervals.   This
standard  is known  as ISO  8601.  The  text below  refers to  the third
edition of that  standard, which was published on  1 December 2004.  Its
title  is:  ISO 8601:2004,  "Data  elements  and  interchange formats  -
Information interchange - Representation of dates and times".

  The text below is not  an exhaustive description of everything you may
find in  ISO 8601; it does,  however, try to capture  the most important
points.


3.1. What date format does the Standard mandate?
------------------------------------------------

There are  three basic  formats: Calendar date,  ordinal date,  and week
date.

* A calendar date  should be written as a  4-digit year number, followed
  by a  2-digit month number, followed  by a 2-digit  day number.  Thus,
  for example, 2 August 1953 may be written:

    19530802    or    1953-08-02

* An ordinal date  should be written as a  4-digit year number, followed
  by a 3-digit number indicating the  number of the day within the year.
  Thus, for example, 2 August 1953 may be written:

    1953214     or    1953-214

  2 August is the 214th day of a non-leap year.

* A week date should be written  as a 4-digit year number, followed by a
  W, followed  by a 2-digit week  number followed by a  1-digit week day
  number  (1=Monday,  2=Tuesday, ...,  7=Sunday).   The  week number  is
  defined  in section  7.7.  Thus,  for example,  2 August  1953  may be
  written:

    1953W317    or    1953-W31-7

  2 August was the Sunday of week 31 of 1953.

  In all the examples above, the hyphens are optional.

  Note that you must always write all the digits.  Thus the year 47 must
be written as 0047.


3.2. What time format does the Standard mandate?
------------------------------------------------

A 24-hour  clock must  be used.  A  time is  written as a  2-digit hour,
followed by a 2-digit minute,  followed by a 2-digit second, followed by
a  comma, followed  by a  number of  digits indicating  a fraction  of a
second.  For example, thus:

   140812,35   or   14:08:12,35

  The  fraction, the seconds,  and the  minutes may  be omitted  if less
accuracy is required:

   140812   or   14:08:12
   1408     or   14:08
   14

  In all the  examples above, the colons are optional.  The comma may be
replaced by a period (.), but this is not recommended.

  The time  may optionally be followed  by a time  zone indication.  For
UTC, the  time zone indication is  the letter Z.  For  other time zones,
the indication is a plus or minus followed by the time difference to UTC
(plus for times  east of Greenwich, minus for  times west of Greenwich).
For example:

    1130Z       (11:30 UTC)
    1130+0430   (11:30, at a location 4 and a half hours ahead of UTC)
    1130-05     (11:30, at a location 5 hours behind of UTC)


3.3. What if I want to specify both a date and a time?
------------------------------------------------------

Date and time indications can be strung together by putting the letter T
between them.  For  example, ten minutes to 7 p.m. on  2 August 1953 may
be written as:

    19530802T185000   or   1953-08-02T18:50:00


3.4. What format does the Standard mandate for a time interval?
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are several to choose from.  A time interval can be specified as a
starting time and an ending time or as a duration together with either a
starting time or an ending time.

  There are too many  details to cover here, so I shall  only give a few
examples:

* Using starting time and ending time:

    1998-12-01T12:03/2004-04-02T14:12

* Using starting time and duration:

    1927-03-12T08:04/P1Y4M12DT6H30M9S

  This last example  should be read as the time  interval starting on 12
March 1927 at 08:04 and lasting for  1 year, 4 months, 12 days, 6 hours,
30 minutes, and  9 seconds.  The letter P  following the slash indicates
that a duration follows.


3.5. Can I write BC dates and dates after the year 9999 using ISO 8601?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can.

  The year 1 BC must be written  as 0000.  The year 2 BC must be written
as -0001, the year 3 BC must be written as -0002 etc.

  Years of more than 4 digits must be written with an initial plus sign.
Thus the year AD 10000 must be written as +10000.


3.6. Can I write dates in the Julian calendar using ISO 8601?
-------------------------------------------------------------

No.  The Standard  requires that the Gregorian calendar  be used for all
dates.   Dates before  the introduction  of the  Gregorian  calendar are
written using the proleptic  Gregorian calendar (see section 2.9).  This
is one of the few places where the proleptic Gregorian calendar is used.

  Thus  the Julian  date 12  March 826  must be  written  as 0826-03-16,
because its equivalent date in the Gregorian calendar is 16 March.


3.7. Does the Standard define the Gregorian calendar?
-----------------------------------------------------

Yes,  ISO   8601  specifies  how  the  Gregorian   calendar  works.  The
specification is  completely compatible  with the calendar  specified by
Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, except  that ISO 8601 does not concern itself
with the calculation of Easter.

  However,  the calendar  reference point  used by  the Standard  is not
Christ's birth but the date  on which the metric convention ("Convention
du Metre") was signed in Paris.  The Standard defines that date to be 20
May 1875.

  Similarly, the reference  point of the week cycles  is 1 January 2000,
which is defined to be a Saturday.

  Of course, these reference  points are also completely compatible with
common usage.


3.8. What does the Standard say about the week?
-----------------------------------------------

According to ISO 8601, Monday is the first day of the week.

  Each  week has a  number.  A  week that  lies partly  in one  year and
partly in another is assigned a number  in the year in which most of its
days lie.  The Standard specifies this by saying that week 1 of any year
is the week that includes the first Thursday of that year.

  More details can  be found in chapter 7, which deals  with the week in
greater detail.


3.9. Why are ISO 8601 dates not used in this Calendar FAQ?
----------------------------------------------------------

The  Standard specifies  how  to  write dates  using  only numbers.  The
Standard explicitly  does not  cover the cases  where dates  are written
using words  (such as  January, February, etc.).  In fact,  the Standard
itself makes frequent use of dates such as "20 May 1875" and "15 October
1582".

  In other words, ISO 8601 helps people with data communication where it
is natural  to use all-number  dates.  In everyday language  (spoken and
written) we are free to use the terms we like best.


3.10. Where can I get the Standard?
-----------------------------------

If you are looking for a free copy somewhere on the internet, forget it!
ISO makes money from selling copies of their standards.

  ISO 8601:2004 can be bought from ISO at http://www.iso.ch.  It is very
expensive.   The last time  I checked,  the price  was 124  Swiss Francs
(about U.S. $97) for a 33 page document.

  Your local library may be able to find a copy for you.



4. The Hebrew Calendar
----------------------

The current definition of the  Hebrew calendar is generally said to have
been set down  by the Sanhedrin president Hillel  II in approximately AD
359.  The original details of his calendar are, however, uncertain.

  The Hebrew  calendar is used for  religious purposes by  Jews all over
the world, and it is the official calendar of Israel.

  The Hebrew  calendar is  a combined solar/lunar  calendar, in  that it
strives to have its years coincide with the tropical year and its months
coincide with the  synodic months.  This is a  complicated goal, and the
rules for the Hebrew calendar are correspondingly fascinating.


4.1. What does a Hebrew year look like?
---------------------------------------

An ordinary (non-leap) year has 353,  354, or 355 days.  A leap year has
383,  384, or  385 days.   The three  lengths of  the years  are termed,
"deficient", "regular", and "complete", respectively.

  An ordinary year has 12 months, a leap year has 13 months.

  Every month starts (approximately) on the day of a new moon.

  The months and their lengths are:

              Length in a      Length in a     Length in a
    Name      deficient year   regular year    complete year
    -------   --------------   ------------    -------------
    Tishri          30              30              30
    Heshvan         29              29              30
    Kislev          29              30              30
    Tevet           29              29              29
    Shevat          30              30              30
    (Adar I         30              30              30)
    Adar II         29              29              29
    Nisan           30              30              30
    Iyar            29              29              29
    Sivan           30              30              30
    Tammuz          29              29              29
    Av              30              30              30
    Elul            29              29              29
    -------   --------------   ------------    -------------
    Total:      353 or 383      354 or 384      355 or 385

  The month  Adar I is  only present in  leap years.  In  non-leap years
Adar II is simply called "Adar".

  Note  that in  a  regular year  the  numbers 30  and  29 alternate;  a
complete year is created by adding a day to Heshvan, whereas a deficient
year is created by removing a day from Kislev.

  The alteration of  30 and 29 ensures that when the  year starts with a
new moon, so does each month.


4.2. What years are leap years?
-------------------------------

A  year is  a leap  year  if the  number 'year  mod  19' is  one of  the
following: 0, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, or 17.

  The value  for year in this  formula is the "Anno  Mundi" described in
section 4.8.


4.3. What years are deficient, regular, and complete?
-----------------------------------------------------

That is the wrong question to ask.  The correct question to ask is: when
does a  Hebrew year  begin?  Once you  have answered that  question (see
section 4.6),  the length of  the year is  the number of days  between 1
Tishri in one year and 1 Tishri in the following year.


4.4. When is New Year's day?
----------------------------

That depends.   Jews have  several different days  to choose  from.  The
most important are:

1 Tishri:
    "Rosh HaShanah".  This  day is a celebration of  the creation of the
    world and marks the start of  a new calendar year.  This will be the
    day we shall base our calculations on in the following sections.

1 Nisan:
    "New Year for Kings".  This is also the start of the religious year.
    Nisan  is considered  the first  month, although  it occurs  6  or 7
    months after the start of the calendar year.


3.5. When does a Hebrew day begin?
----------------------------------

A Hebrew-calendar day  does not begin at midnight,  but at either sunset
or when  three medium-sized  stars should be  visible, depending  on the
religious circumstance.

  Sunset marks  the start of the  12 night hours,  whereas sunrise marks
the  start of the  12 day  hours.  This  means that  night hours  may be
longer or shorter than day hours, depending on the season.


4.6. When does a Hebrew year begin?
-----------------------------------

The  first day  of the  calendar  year, Rosh  HaShanah, on  1 Tishri  is
determined as follows:

1) The new year starts on the  day of the new moon that occurs about 354
   days  (or 384 days  if the  previous year  was a  leap year)  after 1
   Tishri of the previous year

2) If the new moon occurs after  noon on that day, delay the new year by
   one day.  (Because in  that case  the new crescent  moon will  not be
   visible until the next day.)

3) If this would cause the new  year to start on a Sunday, Wednesday, or
   Friday, delay  it by  one day.   (Because we want  to avoid  that Yom
   Kippur (10  Tishri) falls  on a Friday  or Sunday, and  that Hoshanah
   Rabba (21 Tishri) falls on a Sabbath (Saturday)).

4)  If two  consecutive  years start  356  days apart  (an illegal  year
   length), delay the start of the first year by two days.

5)  If two  consecutive  years start  382  days apart  (an illegal  year
   length), delay the start of the second year by one day.


  Note: Rule 4 can only come into play if the first year was supposed to
start on a Tuesday.  Therefore a two day delay is used rather than a one
day delay, as the  year must not start on a Wednesday  as stated in rule
3.


4.7. When is the new moon?
--------------------------

A calculated new moon is  used. In order to understand the calculations,
one must know that an hour is subdivided into 1080 "parts".

The calculations are as follows:

The new moon that started the year  AM 1, occurred 5 hours and 204 parts
after sunset  (i.e. just before midnight  on Julian date  6 October 3761
BC).

The new moon of any  particular year is calculated by extrapolating from
this time, using a synodic month of 29 days 12 hours and 793 parts.

Note that 18:00 Jerusalem time (15:39  UTC) is used instead of sunset in
all these calculations.


4.8. How does one count years?
------------------------------

Years are counted  since the creation of the world,  which is assumed to
have taken  place in the  autumn of 3760  BC.  In that year,  after less
than a week belonging  to AM 1, AM 2 started (AM =  Anno Mundi = year of
the world).   In other words,  AM 2 started  less than a week  after the
"creation of the world".

  In the year AD 2008 we shall witness the start of Hebrew year AM 5769.


4.9. When was Passover in AD 30?
--------------------------------

People who ask this question  are normally trying to calculate the exact
date of Jesus' death.

  The New Testament states that Jesus  died on a Friday at the beginning
of  the Jewish Passover,  and that  his resurrection  took place  on the
following Sunday.  However,  it is not quite clear  if Jesus' death took
place  immediately before the  start of  the Jewish  Passover or  on the
first day of Passover.  Since Passover starts on 15 Nisan, it is unclear
if Jesus died on 14 or 15 Nisan.

  This  question is important  for Christian  historians because  if you
know the date, you may with some degree of confidence also calculate the
year; all you have to do is find  a year near AD 30 where 14 or 15 Nisan
fell on a Friday.

  The problem  is that  we don't  know the exact  details of  the Hebrew
calendar as it  was used in the first century.  This  means that we have
to allow for a  margin of a day or two in  the calculations, and this in
turn means that we are left with quite a few possible dates.

  Through the centuries several different dates for the crucifixion have
been suggested.   Currently, the most  common theories suggest  either 7
April AD 30 or 3 April AD 33.

  (I frequently  receive e-mail  proposing very different  approaches to
calculating the date  for Jesus' death, including claims  that Jesus did
not die on a Friday or that he  did not die on 14 or 15 Nisan.  However,
the  statements made  in this  section describe  the most  commonly held
views.  A detailed discussion on the  dating can be found in Blackburn &
Holford-Strevens' brilliant book which I mention in section 11.6.)



5. The Islamic Calendar
-----------------------

The Islamic calendar (or Hijri calendar) is a purely lunar calendar.  It
contains 12 months that are based on the motion of the moon, and because
12 synodic months is only  12*29.53=354.36 days, the Islamic calendar is
consistently shorter than a tropical  year, and therefore it shifts with
respect to the Christian calendar.

  The calendar  is based on the  Qur'an (Sura IX, 36-37)  and its proper
observance is a sacred duty for Muslims.

  The Islamic calendar is the  official calendar in countries around the
Gulf, especially Saudi  Arabia (but see section 5.5).   But other Muslim
countries use the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes and only turn to
the Islamic calendar for religious purposes.


5.1. What does an Islamic year look like?
-----------------------------------------

The names of the 12 months that comprise the Islamic year are:

    1. Muharram                          7. Rajab
    2. Safar                             8. Sha'ban
    3. Rabi' al-awwal (Rabi' I)          9. Ramadan
    4. Rabi' al-thani (Rabi' II)        10. Shawwal
    5. Jumada al-awwal (Jumada I)       11. Dhu al-Qi'dah
    6. Jumada al-thani (Jumada II)      12. Dhu al-Hijjah

(Due  to  different  transliterations  of  the  Arabic  alphabet,  other
spellings of the months are possible.)

  Each month starts when the lunar  crescent is first seen (by an actual
human being) after a new moon.

  Although  new moons  may  be calculated  quite  precisely, the  actual
visibility  of the  crescent  is  much more  difficult  to predict.   It
depends  on factors  such  as  weather, the  optical  properties of  the
atmosphere,  and the  location of  the observer.   It is  therefore very
difficult to give accurate information in advance about when a new month
will start.

  Furthermore,  some Muslims  depend on  a local  sighting of  the moon,
whereas  others depend  on a  sighting by  authorities somewhere  in the
Muslim world.  Both are  valid Islamic practices,  but they may  lead to
different starting days for the months.


5.2. So you can't print an Islamic calendar in advance?
-------------------------------------------------------

Not  a  reliable  one.  However,  calendars  are  printed  for  planning
purposes, but such calendars are based on estimates of the visibility of
the lunar  crescent, and  the actual  month may start  a day  earlier or
later than predicted in the printed calendar.

  Different methods for estimating the calendars are used.

  Some sources mention  a crude system in which  all odd numbered months
have 30 days and all even numbered months have 29 days with an extra day
added to the last month in  "leap years" (a concept otherwise unknown in
the calendar).  Leap years could then be years in which the number 'year
mod 30' is one of the following: 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26, or
29.  (This  is the  algorithm used  in the calendar  program of  the Gnu
Emacs editor.)

  Such a calendar  would give an average month  length of 29.53056 days,
which is quite  close to the synodic month of 29.53059  days, so *on the
average* it would be quite accurate,  but in any given month it is still
just a rough estimate.

  Better algorithms for  estimating the visibility of the  new moon have
been devised, and a number of computer programs with this purpose exist.


5.3. How does one count years?
------------------------------

Years are  counted since  the Hijra, that  is, Mohammed's  emigration to
Medina  in AD 622.   On 16  July (Julian  calendar) of  that year,  AH 1
started (AH = Anno Hegirae = year of the Hijra).

  In the year AD 2008 we witness  the start of Islamic years AH 1429 (in
January) and 1430 (in December).

  Note  that  although  only  2008-622=1386  years have  passed  in  the
Christian  calendar, 1429  years have  passed in  the  Islamic calendar,
because its  year is  consistently shorter (by  about 11 days)  than the
tropical year used by the Christian calendar.


5.4. When will the Islamic calendar overtake the Gregorian calendar?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

As the  year in the Islamic calendar  is about 11 days  shorter than the
year in the Christian calendar,  the Islamic years are slowly gaining in
on  the Christian  years.  But  it  will be  many years  before the  two
coincide.  The  1st day of  the 5th month  of AD 20874 in  the Gregorian
calendar will also be (approximately) the 1st day of the 5th month of AH
20874 of the Islamic calendar.


5.5. Doesn't Saudi Arabia have special rules?
---------------------------------------------

[For civil (but not religious) purposes,] Saudi Arabia doesn't rely on a
visual  sighting  of  the crescent  moon  to  fix  the  start of  a  new
month.  Instead they base  their calendar  on a  calculated astronomical
moon.

  Since 2002 (AH 1423) the rule has  been as follows: if on the 29th day
of an Islamic month,

   * The geocentric conjunction (that is,  the new moon as seen from the
     centre of the earth) occurs before sunset, and

   * The moon sets after the sun,

then the next day  will be the first of a new  month; otherwise the next
day will be the last (30th) of the current month.

  The times for  the setting of the sun and the  moon are calculated for
the coordinates of Mecca.



6. The Persian Calendar
-----------------------

The  Persian calendar is  a solar  calendar with  a starting  point that
matches  that  of  the  Islamic  calendar.  Apart  from  that,  the  two
calendars are  not related.  The origin  of the Persian  calendar can be
traced back to  the 11th century when a  group of astronomers (including
the well-known poet  Omar Khayyam) created what is  known as the Jalaali
calendar.  However, a  number of changes have been  made to the calendar
since then.

  The  current  calendar  has  been  used  in Iran  since  1925  and  in
Afghanistan since 1957.  However,  Afghanistan used the Islamic calendar
in the years 1999-2002.


6.1. What does a Persian year look like?
----------------------------------------

The names  and lengths of the  12 months that comprise  the Persian year
are:

    1. Farvardin   (31 days)      7. Mehr    (30 days)
    2. Ordibehesht (31 days)      8. Aban    (30 days)
    3. Khordad     (31 days)      9. Azar    (30 days)
    4. Tir         (31 days)     10. Day     (30 days)
    5. Mordad      (31 days)     11. Bahman  (30 days)
    6. Shahrivar   (31 days)     12. Esfand  (29/30 days)

  (Due  to different  transliterations  of the  Persian alphabet,  other
spellings of  the months are  possible.)  In Afghanistan the  months are
named differently.

  The month of Esfand has 29 days in an ordinary year, 30 days in a leap
year.


6.2. When does the Persian year begin?
--------------------------------------

The Persian year  starts at vernal equinox.  If  the astronomical vernal
equinox falls before  noon (Tehran true time) on  a particular day, then
that  day is  the first  day of  the year.   If the  astronomical vernal
equinox falls  after noon,  the following  day is the  first day  of the
year.


6.3. How does one count years?
------------------------------

As  in the  Islamic  calendar  (section 5.3),  years  are counted  since
Mohammed's emigration  to Medina  in AD 622.  At vernal equinox  of that
year, AP 1 started (AP = Anno Persico/Anno Persarum = Persian year).

  Note  that contrary  to  the Islamic  calendar,  the Persian  calendar
counts solar years.  In the year AD 2008 we have therefore witnessed the
start of Persian year 1387, but the start of Islamic year 1429.


6.4. What years are leap years?
-------------------------------

Since the  Persian year is  defined by the astronomical  vernal equinox,
the answer is  simply: leap years are years in which  there are 366 days
between two Persian new year's days.

  However,  basing  the  Persian  calendar  purely  on  an  astronomical
observation  of  the vernal  equinox  is rejected  by  many,  and a  few
mathematical  rules for  determining the  length of  the year  have been
suggested.

  The most popular (and complex) of these is probably the following:

  The calendar is divided into periods of 2820 years.  These periods are
then divided into 88 cycles whose lengths follow this pattern:

    29, 33, 33, 33, 29, 33, 33, 33, 29, 33, 33, 33, ...

  This  gives  2816 years.   The  total of  2820  years  is achieved  by
extending the last cycle by 4 years (for a total of 37 years).

  If you number  the years within each cycle starting  with 0, then leap
years are the years  that are divisible by 4, except that  the year 0 is
not a leap year.

  So within, say, a 29 year cycle, this is the leap year pattern:

    Year            Year              Year              Year
     0  Ordinary      8  Leap          16  Leap          24  Leap
     1  Ordinary      9  Ordinary      17  Ordinary      25  Ordinary
     2  Ordinary     10  Ordinary      18  Ordinary      26  Ordinary
     3  Ordinary     11  Ordinary      19  Ordinary      27  Ordinary
     4  Leap         12  Leap          20  Leap          28  Leap
     5  Ordinary     13  Ordinary      21  Ordinary
     6  Ordinary     14  Ordinary      22  Ordinary
     7  Ordinary     15  Ordinary      23  Ordinary

  This  gives  a  total  of  683  leap years  every  2820  years,  which
corresponds  to an  average  year  length of  365  683/2820 =  365.24220
days.  This is  a better  approximation to  the tropical  year  than the
365.2425 days of the Gregorian calendar.

  The current 2820 year period started in the year AP 475 (AD 1096).

  This  "mathematical"  calendar currently  coincides  closely with  the
purely astronomical calendar.  In the years between AP 1244 and 1531 (AD
1865 and 2152) a discrepancy of one day is seen twice, namely in AP 1404
and 1437  (starting at  vernal equinox of  AD 2025 and  2058).  However,
outside this period, discrepancies are more frequent.



7. The Week
-----------

The Christian,  the Hebrew, the  Islamic, and the Persian  calendars all
have a 7-day week.


7.1. What is the origin of the 7-day week?
------------------------------------------

Digging into the history of the 7-day week is a very complicated matter.
Authorities have very different opinions  about the history of the week,
and  they  frequently  present   their  speculations  as  if  they  were
indisputable facts.  In short, nothing  can be said with certainty about
the origin of the 7-day week.

  The first pages of the Bible  explain how God created the world in six
days and rested on the seventh.   This seventh day became the Jewish day
of rest, the Sabbath, Saturday.

  Extra-biblical locations sometimes mentioned  as the birthplace of the
7-day week include:  Babylon, Persia, and several others.   The week was
known in Rome before the advent of Christianity.


7.2. What do the names of the days of the week mean?
----------------------------------------------------

An answer to this question is necessarily closely linked to the
language in question. Whereas most languages use the same names for
the months (with a few Slavonic languages as notable exceptions),
there is great variety in names that various languages use for the
days of the week. A few examples will be given here.

Except for the Sabbath, Jews simply number their week days.

A related method is partially used in Portuguese and Russian:

   English    Portuguese      Russian        Meaning of Russian name
   -------    ----------      -------        -----------------------
   Monday     segunda-feira   ponedelnik     After "do-nothing"
   Tuesday    terca-feira     vtornik        Second
   Wednesday  quarta-feira    sreda          Middle
   Thursday   quinta-feira    chetverg       Fourth
   Friday     sexta-feira     pyatnitsa      Fifth
   Saturday   sabado          subbota        Sabbath
   Sunday     domingo         voskresenye    Resurrection

Most Latin-based languages connect each day of the week with one of
the seven "planets" of the ancient times: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. French, for example, uses:

   English     French         "Planet"
   -------     ------         --------
   Monday      lundi          Moon
   Tuesday     mardi          Mars
   Wednesday   mercredi       Mercury
   Thursday    jeudi          Jupiter
   Friday      vendredi       Venus
   Saturday    samedi         Saturn
   Sunday      dimanche       (Sun)

The link with the sun has been broken in French, but Sunday was
called "dies solis" (day of the sun) in Latin.

It is interesting to note that also some Asiatic languages (for
example, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean) have a similar relationship
between the week days and the planets.

English has retained the original planets in the names for Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday. For the four other days, however, the names of
Anglo-Saxon or Nordic gods have replaced the Roman gods that gave
name to the planets. Thus, Tuesday is named after Tiw, Wednesday is
named after Woden, Thursday is named after Thor, and Friday is named
after Frigg.


7.3. What is the system behind the planetary day names?
-------------------------------------------------------

As we saw in the previous section, the planets have given the week
days their names following this order:

   Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Sun

Why this particular order?

One theory goes as follows: If you order the "planets" according to
either their presumed distance from Earth (assuming the Earth to be
the centre of the universe) or their period of revolution around the
Earth, you arrive at this order:

   Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn

Now, assign (in reverse order) these planets to the hours of the day:

   1=Saturn, 2=Jupiter, 3=Mars, 4=Sun, 5=Venus, 6=Mercury, 7=Moon,
   8=Saturn, 9=Jupiter, etc., 23=Jupiter, 24=Mars

The next day will then continue where the old day left off:

  1=Sun, 2=Venus, etc., 23=Venus, 24=Mercury

And the next day will go

  1=Moon, 2=Saturn, etc.

If you look at the planet assigned to the first hour of each day, you
will note that the planets come in this order:

   Saturn, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus

This is exactly the order of the associated week days.

Coincidence? Maybe.


7.4. Has the 7-day week cycle ever been interrupted?
----------------------------------------------------

There is no record of the 7-day week cycle ever having been broken.
Calendar changes and reform have never interrupted the 7-day cycles.
It is very likely that the week cycles have run uninterrupted at least
since the days of Moses (c. 1400 BC), possibly even longer.

Some sources claim that the ancient Jews used a calendar in which an
extra Sabbath was occasionally introduced. But this is probably not
true.


7.5. Which day is the day of rest?
----------------------------------

For the Jews, the Sabbath (Saturday) is the day of rest and
worship. On this day God rested after creating the world.

Most Christians have made Sunday their day of rest and worship,
because Jesus rose from the dead on a Sunday.

Muslims use Friday as their day of rest and worship. The Qur'an
calls Friday a holy day, the "king of days".


7.6. What is the first day of the week?
---------------------------------------

The Bible clearly makes the Sabbath (correspondiong to our Saturday)
the last day of the week. Therefore it is common Jewish and Christian
practice to regard Sunday as the first day of the week (as is also
evident from the Portuguese names for the week days mentioned in
section 7.2). However, the fact that, for example, Russian uses the
name "second" for Tuesday, indicates that some nations regard Monday
as the first day.

In international standard ISO 8601 (see chapter 3) the International
Organization for Standardization has decreed that Monday shall be the
first day of the week.


7.7. What is the week number?
-----------------------------

International standard ISO 8601 (see chapter 3) assigns a number to
each week of the year. A week that lies partly in one year and partly
in another is assigned a number in the year in which most of its days
lie. This means that

        Week 1 of any year is the week that contains 4 January,

or equivalently

        Week 1 of any year is the week that contains the first
        Thursday in January.

Most years have 52 weeks, but years that start on a Thursday and leap
years that start on a Wednesday have 53 weeks.

Note: This week numbering system is not commonly used in the United
States.


7.8. How can I calculate the week number?
-----------------------------------------

If you know the date, you can calculate the corresponding week number
(as defined in ISO 8601) as descibed below. (The divisions are integer
divisions in which the remainder is discarded.)

For dates in January and February, calculate:

    a = year-1
    b = a/4 - a/100 + a/400
    c = (a-1)/4 - (a-1)/100 + (a-1)/400
    s = b-c
    e = 0
    f = day - 1 + 31*(month-1)

For dates in March through December, calculate:

    a = year
    b = a/4 - a/100 + a/400
    c = (a-1)/4 - (a-1)/100 + (a-1)/400
    s = b-c
    e = s+1
    f = day + (153*(month-3)+2)/5 + 58 + s

Then, for any month continue thus:

    g = (a + b) mod 7
    d = (f + g - e) mod 7
    n = f + 3 - d

We now have three situations:

    If n<0, the day lies in week 53-(g-s)/5 of the previous year.
    If n>364+s, the day lies in week 1 of the coming year.
    Otherwise, the day lies in week n/7 + 1 of the current year.

This algorithm gives you a couple of additional useful values:

    d indicates the day of the week (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, etc.)
    f+1 is the ordinal number of the date within the current year.


7.9. Do weeks of different lengths exist?
-----------------------------------------

If you define a "week" as a 7-day period, obviously the answer is
no. But if you define a "week" as a named interval that is greater
than a day and smaller than a month, the answer is yes.

The ancient Egyptians used a 10-day "week", as did the French
Revolutionary calendar (see section 8.1).

The Maya calendar uses a 13 and a 20-day "week" (see section 9.2).

The Soviet Union has used both a 5-day and a 6-day week. In 1929-30
the USSR gradually introduced a 5-day week. Every worker had one day
off every week, but there was no fixed day of rest. On 1 September
1931 this was replaced by a 6-day week with a fixed day of rest,
falling on the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 30th day of each month (1
March was used instead of the 30th day of February, and the last day
of months with 31 days was considered an extra working day outside
the normal 6-day week cycle). A return to the normal 7-day week was
decreed on 26 June 1940.



8. The French Revolutionary Calendar
------------------------------------

The French Revolutionary Calendar (or Republican Calendar) was
introduced in France on 24 November 1793 and abolished on 1 January
1806. It was used again briefly during the Paris Commune in 1871.


8.1. What does a Republican year look like?
-------------------------------------------

A year consists of 365 or 366 days, divided into 12 months of 30 days
each, followed by 5 or 6 additional days. The months were:

1. Vendemiaire           7. Germinal
2. Brumaire              8. Floreal
3. Frimaire              9. Prairial
4. Nivose               10. Messidor
5. Pluviose             11. Thermidor
6. Ventose              12. Fructidor

(The second e in Vendemiaire and the e in Floreal carry an acute
accent. The o's in Nivose, Pluviose, and Ventose carry a circumflex
accent.)

The year was not divided into weeks, instead each month was divided
into three "decades" of 10 days, of which the final day was a day of
rest. This was an attempt to de-Christianize the calendar, but it was
an unpopular move, because now there were 9 work days between each day
of rest, whereas the Gregorian Calendar had only 6 work days between
each Sunday.

The ten days of each decade were called, respectively, Primidi, Duodi,
Tridi, Quartidi, Quintidi, Sextidi, Septidi, Octidi, Nonidi, Decadi.

The 5 or 6 additional days followed the last day of Fructidor and were
called:
      1. Jour de la vertu (Day of virtue)
      2. Jour du genie (Day of genius)
      3. Jour du travail (Day of labour)
      4. Jour de l'opinion (Day of opinion)
      5. Jour des recompenses (Day of rewards)
      6. Jour de la revolution (Day of the revolution)  (the leap day)

(Different sources refer to these days as either "jour" ("day") or
"fete" ("celebration" or "feast").)

Each year was supposed to start on autumnal equinox (around 22
September), but this created problems as will be seen in section 8.3.


8.2. How does one count years?
------------------------------

Years are counted since the establishment of the first French Republic
on 22 September 1792. That day became 1 Vendemiaire of the year 1 of
the Republic. (However, the Revolutionary Calendar was not introduced
until 24 November 1793.)


8.3. What years are leap years?
-------------------------------

Leap years were introduced to keep New Year's Day on autumnal
equinox. But this turned out to be difficult to handle, because
equinox is not completely simple to predict.

In fact, the first decree implementing the calendar (5 Oct 1793)
contained two contradictory rules, as it stated that:
  - the first day of each year would be that of the autumnal equinox
  - every 4th year would be a leap year

In practice, the first calendars were based on the equinoxial
condition.

To remove the confusion, a rule similar to the one used in the
Gregorian Calendar (including a 4000 year rule as described in section
2.2.2) was proposed by the calendar's author, Gilbert Romme, but his
proposal ran into political problems.

In short, during the time when the French Revolutionary Calendar was
in use, the following years were leap years: 3, 7, and 11.


8.4. How does one convert a Republican date to a Gregorian one?
---------------------------------------------------------------

The following table lists the Gregorian date on which each year of the
Republic started:

Year  1: 22 Sep 1792            Year  8: 23 Sep 1799
Year  2: 22 Sep 1793            Year  9: 23 Sep 1800
Year  3: 22 Sep 1794            Year 10: 23 Sep 1801
Year  4: 23 Sep 1795            Year 11: 23 Sep 1802
Year  5: 22 Sep 1796            Year 12: 24 Sep 1803
Year  6: 22 Sep 1797            Year 13: 23 Sep 1804
Year  7: 22 Sep 1798            Year 14: 23 Sep 1805



9. The Maya Calendar
--------------------

(I am very grateful to Chris Carrier for providing most of the
information about the Maya calendar.)

Among their other accomplishments, the ancient Mayas invented a
calendar of remarkable accuracy and complexity. The Maya calendar was
adopted by the other Mesoamerican nations, such as the Aztecs and the
Toltec, which adopted the mechanics of the calendar unaltered but
changed the names of the days of the week and the months.

The Maya calendar uses three different dating systems in parallel, the
"Long Count", the "Tzolkin" (divine calendar), and the "Haab" (civil
calendar).  Of these, only the Haab has a direct relationship to the
length of the year.

A typical Mayan date looks like this: 12.18.16.2.6, 3 Cimi 4 Zotz.

12.18.16.2.6 is the Long Count date.
3 Cimi is the Tzolkin date.
4 Zotz is the Haab date.


9.1. What is the Long Count?
----------------------------

The Long Count is really a mixed base-20/base-18 representation of a
number, representing the number of days since the start of the Mayan
era. It is thus akin to the Julian Day Number (see section 2.16).

The basic unit is the "kin" (day), which is the last component of the
Long Count. Going from right to left the remaining components are:

   uinal  (1 uinal = 20 kin = 20 days)
   tun    (1 tun = 18 uinal = 360 days = approx. 1 year)
   katun  (1 katun = 20 tun = 7,200 days = approx. 20 years)
   baktun (1 baktun = 20 katun = 144,000 days = approx. 394 years)

The kin, tun, and katun are numbered from 0 to 19.
The uinal are numbered from 0 to 17.
The baktun are numbered from 1 to 13.

Although they are not part of the Long Count, the Mayas had names for
larger time spans. The following names are sometimes quoted, although
they are not ancient Maya terms:

   1 pictun = 20 baktun = 2,880,000 days = approx. 7885 years
   1 calabtun = 20 pictun = 57,600,000 days = approx. 158,000 years
   1 kinchiltun = 20 calabtun = 1,152,000,000 days = approx. 3 million years
   1 alautun = 20 kinchiltun = 23,040,000,000 days = approx. 63 million years


9.1.1. When did the Long Count start?
-------------------------------------

Logically, the first date in the Long Count should be 0.0.0.0.0, but
as the baktun (the first component) are numbered from 1 to 13 rather
than 0 to 12, this first date is actually written 13.0.0.0.0.

The authorities disagree on what 13.0.0.0.0 corresponds to in our
calendar. I have come across three possible equivalences:

13.0.0.0.0 =  8 Sep 3114 BC (Julian) = 13 Aug 3114 BC (Gregorian)
13.0.0.0.0 =  6 Sep 3114 BC (Julian) = 11 Aug 3114 BC (Gregorian)
13.0.0.0.0 = 11 Nov 3374 BC (Julian) = 15 Oct 3374 BC (Gregorian)

Assuming one of the first two equivalences, the Long Count will again
reach 13.0.0.0.0 on 21 or 23 December AD 2012 - a not too distant future.

The date 13.0.0.0.0 may have been the Mayas' idea of the date of the
creation of the world.


9.2. What is the Tzolkin?
-------------------------

The Tzolkin date is a combination of two "week" lengths.

While our calendar uses a single week of seven days, the Mayan
calendar used two different lengths of week:
   - a numbered week of 13 days, in which the days were numbered from
     1 to 13
   - a named week of 20 days, in which the names of the days were:

        0. Ahau         5. Chicchan     10. Oc          15. Men
        1. Imix         6. Cimi         11. Chuen       16. Cib
        2. Ik           7. Manik        12. Eb          17. Caban
        3. Akbal        8. Lamat        13. Ben         18. Etznab
        4. Kan          9. Muluc        14. Ix          19. Caunac

As the named week is 20 days and the smallest Long Count digit is 20
days, there is synchrony between the two; if, for example, the last
digit of today's Long Count is 0, today must be Ahau; if it is 6, it
must be Cimi. Since the numbered and the named week were both "weeks",
each of their name/number change daily; therefore, the day after 3
Cimi is not 4 Cimi, but 4 Manik, and the day after that, 5 Lamat. The
next time Cimi rolls around, 20 days later, it will be 10 Cimi instead
of 3 Cimi. The next 3 Cimi will not occur until 260 (or 13*20) days
have passed. This 260-day cycle also had good-luck or bad-luck
associations connected with each day, and for this reason, it became
known as the "divinatory year."

The "years" of the Tzolkin calendar are not counted.


9.2.1. When did the Tzolkin start?
----------------------------------

Long Count 13.0.0.0.0 corresponds to 4 Ahau. The authorities agree on
this.


9.3. What is the Haab?
----------------------

The Haab was the civil calendar of the Mayas. It consisted of 18
"months" of 20 days each, followed by 5 extra days, known as
"Uayeb". This gives a year length of 365 days.

The names of the month were:
        1. Pop           7. Yaxkin      13. Mac
        2. Uo            8. Mol         14. Kankin
        3. Zip           9. Chen        15. Muan
        4. Zotz         10. Yax         16. Pax
        5. Tzec         11. Zac         17. Kayab
        6. Xul          12. Ceh         18. Cumku

In contrast to the Tzolkin dates, the Haab month names changed every
20 days instead of daily; so the day after 4 Zotz would be 5 Zotz,
followed by 6 Zotz ... up to 19 Zotz, which is followed by 0 Tzec.

The days of the month were numbered from 0 to 19. This use of a 0th
day of the month in a civil calendar is unique to the Maya system; it
is believed that the Mayas discovered the number zero, and the uses to
which it could be put, centuries before it was discovered in Europe or
Asia.

The Uayeb days acquired a very derogatory reputation for bad luck;
known as "days without names" or "days without souls," and were
observed as days of prayer and mourning. Fires were extinguished and
the population refrained from eating hot food. Anyone born on those
days was "doomed to a miserable life."

The years of the Haab calendar are not counted.

The length of the Tzolkin year was 260 days and the length of the Haab
year was 365 days. The smallest number that can be divided evenly by
260 and 365 is 18,980, or 365*52; this was known as the Calendar
Round. If a day is, for example, "4 Ahau 8 Cumku," the next day
falling on "4 Ahau 8 Cumku" would be 18,980 days or about 52 years
later.  Among the Aztec, the end of a Calendar Round was a time of
public panic as it was thought the world might be coming to an
end. When the Pleiades crossed the horizon on 4 Ahau 8 Cumku, they
knew the world had been granted another 52-year extension.


9.3.1. When did the Haab start?
-------------------------------

Long Count 13.0.0.0.0 corresponds to 8 Cumku. The authorities agree on
this.


9.4. Did the Mayas think a year was 365 days?
---------------------------------------------

Although there were only 365 days in the Haab year, the Mayas were
aware that a year is slightly longer than 365 days, and in fact, many
of the month-names are associated with the seasons; Yaxkin, for
example, means "new or strong sun" and, at the beginning of the Long
Count, 1 Yaxkin was the day after the winter solstice, when the sun
starts to shine for a longer period of time and higher in the
sky. When the Long Count was put into motion, it was started at
7.13.0.0.0, and 0 Yaxkin corresponded with Midwinter Day, as it did at
13.0.0.0.0 back in 3114 B.C. The available evidence indicates that the
Mayas estimated that a 365-day year precessed through all the seasons
twice in 7.13.0.0.0 or 1,101,600 days.

We can therefore derive a value for the Mayan estimate of the year by
dividing 1,101,600 by 365, subtracting 2, and taking that number and
dividing 1,101,600 by the result, which gives us an answer of
365.242036 days, which is slightly more accurate than the 365.2425
days of the Gregorian calendar.

(This apparent accuracy could, however, be a simple coincidence. The
Mayas estimated that a 365-day year precessed through all the seasons
*twice* in 7.13.0.0.0 days. These numbers are only accurate to 2-3
digits. Suppose the 7.13.0.0.0 days had corresponded to 2.001 cycles
rather than 2 cycles of the 365-day year, would the Mayas have noticed?)



10. The Chinese Calendar
------------------------

Although the People's Republic of China uses the Gregorian calendar
for civil purposes, a special Chinese calendar is used for determining
festivals. Various Chinese communities around the world also use this
calendar.

The beginnings of the Chinese calendar can be traced back to the 14th
century BC. Legend has it that the Emperor Huangdi invented the
calendar in 2637 BC.

The Chinese calendar is based on exact astronomical observations of
the longitude of the sun and the phases of the moon. This means that
principles of modern science have had an impact on the Chinese
calendar.

I can recommend visiting Helmer Aslaksen's web site at
http://www.chinesecalendar.net for more information about the Chinese
calendar.


10.1. What does the Chinese year look like?
-------------------------------------------

The Chinese calendar - like the Hebrew - is a combined solar/lunar
calendar in that it strives to have its years coincide with the
tropical year and its months coincide with the synodic months. It is
not surprising that a few similarities exist between the Chinese and
the Hebrew calendar:

   * An ordinary year has 12 months, a leap year has 13 months.
   * An ordinary year has 353, 354, or 355 days, a leap year has 383,
     384, or 385 days.

When determining what a Chinese year looks like, one must make a
number of astronomical calculations:

First, determine the dates for the new moons. Here, a new moon is the
completely "black" moon (that is, when the moon is in conjunction with
the sun), not the first visible crescent used in the Islamic and
Hebrew calendars. The date of a new moon is the first day of a new
month.

Secondly, determine the dates when the sun's longitude is a multiple
of 30 degrees. (The sun's longitude is 0 at Vernal Equinox, 90 at
Summer Solstice, 180 at Autumnal Equinox, and 270 at Winter Solstice.)
These dates are called the "Principal Terms" and are used to determine
the number of each month:

Principal Term 1 occurs when the sun's longitude is 330 degrees.
Principal Term 2 occurs when the sun's longitude is 0 degrees.
Principal Term 3 occurs when the sun's longitude is 30 degrees.
etc.
Principal Term 11 occurs when the sun's longitude is 270 degrees.
Principal Term 12 occurs when the sun's longitude is 300 degrees.

Each month carries the number of the Principal Term that occurs in
that month.

In rare cases, a month may contain two Principal Terms; in this case
the months numbers may have to be shifted. Principal Term 11 (Winter
Solstice) must always fall in the 11th month.

All the astronomical calculations are carried out for the meridian 120
degrees east of Greenwich. This roughly corresponds to the east coast
of China.

Some variations in these rules are seen in various Chinese
communities.


10.2. What years are leap years?
--------------------------------

Leap years have 13 months. To determine if a year is a leap year,
calculate the number of new moons between the 11th month in one year
(i.e., the month containing the Winter Solstice) and the 11th month in
the following year. If there are 13 new moons from the start of the
11th month in the first year to the start of the 11th month in the
second year, a leap month must be inserted.

In leap years, at least one month does not contain a Principal Term.
The first such month is the leap month. It carries the same number as
the previous month, with the additional note that it is the leap
month.


10.3. How does one count years?
-------------------------------

Unlike most other calendars, the Chinese calendar does not count years
in an infinite sequence. Instead years have names that are repeated
every 60 years.

(Historically, years used to be counted since the accession of an
emperor, but this was abolished after the 1911 revolution.)

Within each 60-year cycle, each year is assigned a name consisting of
two components:

The first component is a "Celestial Stem":

        1. jia          6. ji
        2. yi           7. geng
        3. bing         8. xin
        4. ding         9. ren
        5. wu          10. gui

These words have no English equivalent.

The second component is a "Terrestrial Branch":

        1. zi (rat)             7. wu (horse)
        2. chou (ox)            8. wei (sheep)
        3. yin (tiger)          9. shen (monkey)
        4. mao (hare, rabbit)  10. you (rooster)
        5. chen (dragon)       11. xu (dog)
        6. si (snake)          12. hai (pig)

The names of the corresponding animals in the zodiac cycle of 12
animals are given in parentheses.

Each of the two components is used sequentially. Thus, the 1st year of
the 60-year cycle becomes jia-zi, the 2nd year is yi-chou, the 3rd
year is bing-yin, etc. When we reach the end of a component, we start
from the beginning: The 10th year is gui-you, the 11th year is jia-xu
(restarting the Celestial Stem), the 12th year is yi-hai, and the 13th
year is bing-zi (restarting the Terrestrial Branch). Finally, the 60th
year becomes gui-hai.

This way of naming years within a 60-year cycle goes back
approximately 2000 years. A similar naming of days and months has
fallen into disuse, but the date name is still listed in calendars.

It is customary to number the 60-year cycles since 2637 BC, when the
calendar was supposedly invented. In that year the first 60-year cycle
started.


10.4. What is the current year in the Chinese calendar?
-------------------------------------------------------

The current 60-year cycle started on 2 Feb 1984. That date bears the name
bing-yin in the 60-day cycle, and the first month of that first year
bears the name gui-chou in the 60-month cycle.

This means that the year wu-zi, the 25th year in the 78th cycle,
started on 7 Feb 2008.




11. Frequently Asked Questions about this FAQ
---------------------------------------------

This chapter does not answer questions about calendars. Instead it
answers questions that I am often asked about this document.


11.1. Why doesn't the FAQ describe calendar X?
----------------------------------------------

I am frequently asked to add a chapter describing the Japanese
calendar, the Ethiopian calendar, the Hindu calendar, etc.

But I have to stop somewhere. I have discovered that the more calendars
I include in the FAQ, the more difficult it becomes to ensure that the
information given is correct. I want to work on the quality rather
than the quantity of information in this document. It is therefore not
likely that other calendars will be added in the near future.


11.2. Why doesn't the FAQ contain information X?
------------------------------------------------

Obviously, I cannot include everything. So I have to prioritize. The
things that are most likely to be omitted from the FAQ are:

- Information that is relevant to a single country only.
- Views that are controversial and not supported by recognized
  authorities.


11.3. Why don't you reply to my e-mail?
---------------------------------------

I try to reply to all the e-mail I receive. But occasionally the
amount of mail I receive is so large that I have to ignore some
letters. If this has caused your letter to be lost, I apologize.

But please don't let this stop you from writing to me. I enjoy
receiving letters, even if I can't answer them all.


11.4. How do I know that I can trust your information?
------------------------------------------------------

I have tried to be accurate in everything I have described. If you are
unsure about something that I write, I suggest that you try to verify
the information yourself. If you come across a recognized authority
that contradicts something that I've written, please let me know.


11.5. There is an error in one of your formulas!
------------------------------------------------

Is that a question?

Anyway, I very much doubt that that the formulas given in this
document are wrong. Most of the formulas have been tested for all
possible dates between AD 1 and AD 10,000.

When people think they have found an error in a formula, the most
frequent reason is that they have used ordinary division instead of
integer division.


11.6. Can you recommend any good books about calendars?
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a big question because there are so many excellent books. At
this point I shall only recommend three books:

Edward M. Reingold & Nachum Dershowitz: "Calendrical Calculations.
The Millennium Edition". Cambridge University Press 2001.
ISBN 0-521-77752-6.
http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/second-edition/index.html

  This book contains a lot of information about a huge number of
  calendars. As the title indicates, it has a strong emphasis on
  algorithms for calendrical calculations, so if you want to use your
  computer to compute calendars, this is a great book.

Bonnie Blackburn & Leofranc Holford-Strevens: "The Oxford Companion to
the Year". Oxford University Press 1999. ISBN 0-19-214231-3.

  A very thorough (900+ pages) book about the history of calendars.
  The book includes a large collections about customs related to each
  day of the year.

Finally, I have myself written a book:
Claus Tondering: "Julius og Gregor". 2007. ISBN 978-87-92032-58-4.

  Unfortunately, this book is in Danish, but if you can read the
  Scandinavian languages, this is a useful handbook. One of its main
  strengths is a huge collection of tables of various calendars.


11.7. Do you know a web site where I can find information about X?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably not.

Good places to start your calendar search include:

   http://www.calendarzone.com
   http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calendar-reform.html
